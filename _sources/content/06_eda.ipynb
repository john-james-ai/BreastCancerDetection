    "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **CBIS-DDSM** Dataset\n",
    "In this section, we conduct an exploratory data analysis of the CBIS-DDSM Case and DICOM datasets prepared in prior sections. The purpose of this EDA is four-fold:\n",
    "1. Discover the relationships among the features.\n",
    "2. Explore the nature and degree to which features relate to a diagnosis of breast cancer.\n",
    "3. Identify errors, outliers, and anomalies in the data before the modeling stage.\n",
    "4. Assess image quality and develop an appropriate image pre-processing approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Datasets\n",
    "This analysis will involve the following datasets:\n",
    "- Case Datasets: Calcification and mass datasets containing patient, abnormality, BI-RADS assessment, image view, breast density, subtlety, and pathology (diagnosis) information.\n",
    "- DICOM Dataset: Contains image properties, such as image size, shape, bit-depth, aspect ratio, and photometric interpretation.\n",
    "- DICOM Images: The mammography, ROI masks, and cropped images in DICOM format.\n",
