    "In digital mammography preprocessing, thresholding separates structures, features, and regions of interest (ROIs) from the image background based on pixel intensity values and a designated cut-off value or threshold.  From a grayscale image, a binary image is created where the pixel intensity values in the grayscale image are reduced to just two pixel intensity values in the binary image: 0 corresponding to all pixels in the grayscale image that are less than or equal to the threshold, and 1 (or 255 for 8-bit grayscale binary images) corresponding to all pixels in the grayscale image that are greater than the threshold.\n",

    "Segmentation based on pixel intensity thresholds is justified in digital mammography where pixel intensity is the parameter that most directly relates to the spatial characteristics of the structures within a mammogram. For this reason, threshold-based algorithm segmentation is a crucial early step in almost any digital mammography image analysis and preprocessing workflow.\n",

Lower thresholds leave a larger pixel intensity distribution to the foreground, which may include certain artifacts.
