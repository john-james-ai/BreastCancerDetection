    "In digital mammography preprocessing, thresholding separates structures, features, and regions of interest (ROIs) from the image background based on pixel intensity values and a designated cut-off value or threshold.  From a grayscale image, a binary image is created where the pixel intensity values in the grayscale image are reduced to just two pixel intensity values in the binary image: 0 corresponding to all pixels in the grayscale image that are less than or equal to the threshold, and 1 (or 255 for 8-bit grayscale binary images) corresponding to all pixels in the grayscale image that are greater than the threshold.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Border Smoothness**:  Borders tend to become increasingly rough as threshold value increases.\n",
    "- **Information Loss**.  Threshold value and information loss are positively correlated. High thresholds can shrink objects to the background as indicated in {numref}`various_thresholds_fig`  (d).\n",
    "- **Artifact Removal**: On the other hand, some information loss is acceptable if that information is an artifact. Higher thresholds tend to be associated with greater artifact removal.\n",

    "Well, manual techniques can be tedious, and time-consuming, and don’t reflect the inherent variability in digital mammography. No single threshold value will perform consistently across all images.  And though no universally superior *automated* thresholding method exists, several techniques have been proposed, each with distinct performance characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses, that have broad applicability across a range of image analysis and processing domains. We’ll examine those next.\n",

    "- **Clustering-based methods** cluster the gray-level samples into background and foreground. Alternatively, the image is modeled as a mixture of two Gaussians.\n",
    "- **Entropy-based methods** use the entropy of the foreground and background regions, the cross-entropy between the original and binarized image, etc.\n",
    "- **Object attribute-based** methods that analyze the similarity between the gray-level and the binarized images, such as fuzzy shape similarity, edge coincidence, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "{numref}`triangle` was taken from the original paper and geometrically depicts the triangle threshold method. The threshold is selected by first normalizing the dynamic range and the counts of the intensity histogram to values in [0,1]. A line is then constructed between the histogram peak and the tip of the long tail. Point A is selected at the base of the histogram bin that has the maximum perpendicular distance from the ‘peak-to-tip’ line. The threshold is set to A $+\\delta \\ge 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The triangle method assumes pixel intensity distributions with a maximum peak near one end of the histogram and searches for thresholds towards the other end. Hence, this method is particularly well suited for images with highly skewed pixel intensity distributions with a single dominant peak and one or more weak peaks.\n",

    "### ISODATA Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The ISODATA method is an iterative approach based upon the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis algorithm (ISODATA) algorithm {cite}`ridlerPictureThresholdingUsing1978` and is commonly used in biomedical imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it first assigns an initial threshold $T$, usually the average of the pixel intensities in the image. The second step classifies each pixel to the closest class. In the third step, the mean values $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ for each class are estimated using a Gaussian distribution. Next, a new threshold is selected as the average of $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ {cite}`el-zaartImagesThresholdingUsing2010`.  Steps two and three are repeated until the change in threshold is less than a predesignated parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of the ISOData method is that one doesn't need to know much about the properties of the image in advance.  On the other hand, the ISODATA algorithm assumes a symmetric Gaussian pixel distribution and may not perform well with images with a non-symmetric histogram. It can also be time-consuming and computationally expensive for large images.\n",

    "### Otsu's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Otsu's Method {cite}`otsuThresholdSelectionMethod1979`  is a very popular image thresholding technique that separates images into two classes by minimizing the intra-class variance, denoted as $\\sigma^2_w(t)$. Let’s build this from the bottom up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Otsu method initializes the threshold $t=0$, then computes the image histogram and probabilities of each intensity level $p(i)$ denoted as:\n",
    "\n",

    ":label: otsu_prob\n",
    "p(i) = \\frac{n_i}{n}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where  $i$ is a pixel intensity level, $n_i$ is the number of pixels with intensity level $i$, and $n$ is the total number of pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the image is split into two classes: $C_0$  containing all pixels with intensity in the range [0,t), and $C_1$ which contains all pixels with intensity in the range [t, L], where L is the number of bins in the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to obtain weights for $C_0, and $C_1$, denoted $w_0(t)$ and $w_1(t)$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: otsu_weights\n",
    "w_0(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} p(i), \\\\\n",
    "w_1(t) = \\sum_{i=t}^{L-1} p(i),\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the means for $C_0$ and $C_1$, denoted $\\mu_0$ and $\\mu_1$, respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: otsu_means\n",
    "\\mu_0(t) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} ip(i)}{w_0{t}}, \\\\\n",
    "\\mu_1(t) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=t}^{L-1} ip(i)}{w_1{t}},\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we compute the weighted variance of each class, denoted as $\\sigma_0^2$, and $\\sigma_1^2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: otsu_cvar\n",
    "\\sigma_0^2(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1}[i-\\mu_0(t)]^2 \\frac{p(i)}{w_0(t)} \\\\\n",
    "\\sigma_1^2(t) =  \\sum_{i=t}^{L-1}[i-\\mu_1(t)]^2 \\frac{p(i)}{w_1(t)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From {cite}`otsuThresholdSelectionMethod1979`  we have two options to find the threshold. The first is to minimize intra-class variance as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: otsu_ivar\n",
    "\\sigma_w^2(t) =w_0(t)\\sigma^2_0(t)+w_1(t)\\sigma^2_1(t).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method is to maximize inter-class variance as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: otsu_bvar\n",
    "\\sigma_b^2(t) =w_0(t)w_1(t)[\\mu_0(t)-\\mu_1(t)]^2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the general algorithm for minimizing the intra-class variance is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize threshold $t=0$\n",
    "2. Calculate the histogram and intensity level probabilities $p(i)$\n",
    "3. Initialize $w_0(0)$ and $w_1(0)$\n",
    "4. FOR t in range (0,L-1)\n",
    "   - Update values of $w_i,\\mu_i,$ where $w_i$ is the weighted probability and $\\mu_i$ is the mean of class $i$.\n",
    "   - Calculate the intra-class variance value $\\sigma_w^2(t)$\n",
    "5. The final threshold is that which minimizes $\\sigma_w^2(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Otsu method performs well when the image histogram is bimodal with a deep and sharp valley between two peaks {cite}`kittlerThresholdSelectionUsing1985`.  However, the method isn’t the best choice in the presence of heavy noise,  large variances in lighting, or when intra-class variance is larger than inter-class variance.  In such cases, adaptations have been proposed such as the  Kittler-Illingworth method {cite}`kittlerMinimumErrorThresholding1986`.\n",
