    "# Threshold-Based Segmentation (TBS) for Artifact Removal\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing artifacts from an image using threshold-based segmentation involves the partition of the image $I$ into two (or more) regions, typically foreground and background, using a binary image, or mask $B$. Each pixel in the binary mask $B_{i,j}$ can have one of two values: 0 or 1. The value a pixel takes in the binary image depends upon the value of the corresponding pixel $I_{i,j}$ in image $I$ relative to a manually designated, or automatically selected, threshold $T$.  If $I_{i,j} > T$, then the value of the corresponding pixel in the binary mask $B_{i,j}$ is 1, otherwise,  $B_{i,j}$ is 0.\n",
    "In other words,\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: global_threshold\n",
    "M_{i,j} = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & \\text{if} I_{i,j} > T \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{if} I_{I,j} \\le T \\\\\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the binary mask $B$ to the image $I$ results in a new copy of image $I$, say, $I_t$ of the same shape and size as $I$, except all pixels in $I$ that are less than or equal to the threshold $T$ have a value of 0 in $I_t$. All other pixel values remain unchanged. Assuming the threshold $T$ is set appropriately, this places all objects of interest in the foreground (shown as white), and all other objects, artifacts, text, and anomalies in the background (shown as black).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, setting an appropriate threshold is critically important. One that is too low tends to merge too many image structures and results in over-segmentation. A threshold that is too high may remove important structural data from the image.  The simplest approach is to set the threshold $T$ manually. To illustrate, let’s create a binary mask using threshold $T=30$."
