    "Having defined an image $f(x,y)$ as a function of an original image $s(x,y)$ and a noise component $n(x,y)$ ({eq}`additive_noise_model`, and {eq}`multiplicative_noise_model`), we can define the denoising task as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Image denoising aims to provide a function $d(x) \\approx s$ that takes a noisy image $f$ as input and returns an approximation of the true clean image $\\hat{s}$ as output.\n",

    "Our objective is to create an approximation of the original image, $\\hat{s}$ in which:\n",

    "- textures are preserved, and\n",
    "- no new artifacts are generated.\n",

    "Over the past two decades, a considerable body of research has been devoted to the design, development, and testing of denoising methods for biomedical imaging. While a systematic review of the denoising landscape is well beyond the scope of this effort, we will introduce a few of the most commonly used biomedical image denoising methods, with a focus on applications in mammography. Specifically, we will be evaluating the following five methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the denoiser method space is comprised of spatial domain methods and transform domain methods, which we will introduce in the next couple of subsections."
