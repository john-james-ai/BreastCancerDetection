While convenient for modeling, this is rather cumbersome for the exploratory data analysis which considers the entire dataset, before making any assumptions. Our first task is to combine the calcification and mass train and test sets into a single case dataset, facilitating a top-down, comprehensive image_view of all the data for analysis.\n",

The latter indicates that some aspect of the case as worth tracking; but, no follow-up is required. For our purposes, that is a distinction without a difference. Nonetheless, rather than modifying the variable and lose potentially useful information, we'll create a new target variable, 'cancer', which will be True if pathology is 'MALIGNANT', and False otherwise.\n",

    "The CBIS-DDSM creators define a case as a particular abnormality as seen in the cranial caudal (CC) or mediolateral oblique (MLO) image_views; yet, the dataset lacks a unique case identifier. Consequently, five different variables are required to map metadata with their associated image. To enable direct matching between metadata and DICOM images, each case will be assigned a unique identifier, which will be cross-referenced to a full mammogram, ROI mask, or cropped image series dataset."
