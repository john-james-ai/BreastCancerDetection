    "# Frequency Domain Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, we think of an image as a rectangular array of pixels, each pixel representing an intensity at a position in the spatial domain. However, some denoising operations are complicated, or impossible to perform in the spatial domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency domain is a space in which images are represented in terms of frequency rather than time. As such, the frequency domain representation reveals information about an image that is otherwise difficult to see, or not visible in the spatial domain. In particular, the frequency domain reveals the frequency with which pixel values change, information that is used as the basis for low-pass denoising algorithms. Many mathematical operations in the time domain have corresponding, and often simpler, operations in the frequency domain. For instance, convolution and differentiation in the time domain correspond to multiplication in the frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "We convert signals from the time domain into the frequency domain using a mathematical operation called the Fourier transform {cite}`fourierAnalyticalTheoryHeat2007`. Introduced by French mathematician Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier in his 1822 book, La Théorie Analitique de la Chaleur (The Analytic Theory of Heat) {cite}`fourierAnalyticalTheoryHeat2007`, the Fourier transform allows any periodic function, no matter how complicated, to be expressed as the sum of sines and/or cosines of different frequencies, each multiplied by a different coefficient. Functions that are not periodic, but have finite area under the curve, can be expressed as the integral of sines and/or cosines multiplied by a weighting function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, a function expressed as a Fourier transform can be reconstructed by an inverse transform in the spatial domain with no loss of information.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, we will consider three types of frequency domain filters: the *ideal* filter, the Butterworth filter, and the Wavelet domain filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ideal Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The *ideal* filter attenuates unwanted frequencies from a signal while passing the wanted frequencies with uniform sensitivity. It has a ‘brick wall’ profile, in that the gain increases from zero at the stopband, to the higher gain of the passband at a single frequency. The ideal low-pass filter (ILPF) is defined by the following transfer function:\n",

    "The point of transition between the values $H(u,v)=1$ and $H(u,v)=0$ is called the *cutoff frequency*, the frequency at which the filter’s response drops off.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a variety of reasons, the ideal filter cannot be realized; however, its behavior can be studied via simulation. And a characteristic of the ideal filter is significant 'ringing', which occurs when the impulse response oscillates at sharp transitions in the step function and increases with the amount of high-frequency content that is passed. This is an unacceptable aspect, particularly in medical imaging where artifacts can affect clinical diagnoses and outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Butterworth low-pass filter which we will discuss next, avoids this phenomenon by decaying the impulse response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Butterworth Lowpass Filter\n",

    "A 1930 paper by Stephen Butterworth, a British engineer and physicist {cite}`ctx8685948790003821` showed that an ideal filter could be approximated by a low-pass filter whose cutoff frequency was normalized to 1 radian per second. The Butterworth filter has a flat passband and a more gradual transition to the stopband, which eliminates the ringing artifacts characteristic of the ideal low-pass filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Butterworth filter’s stopband begins at the cutoff frequency. The roll-off rate, a measure of how quickly the filter’s response decreases as the frequency increases beyond the cutoff frequency, is controlled by the *order* of the filter. Higher order filters have a steeper roll-off rate, than lower order filters as shown in {numref}`butterworth_ideal`\n",

    "- diagonal fluctuation detail containing high-frequency information ($HH^1$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next level decomposition is applied to the $LL^1$ sub-band only.  This type of 2-D DWT produces a decomposition of approximation coefficients $CA_J$ at level $j$ in the four sub-bands: the approximation $CA_{j+1}$ and the details in three orientations: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, noise tends to dominate high-frequency information. If an appropriate threshold $t$ can be set in the (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) detail coefficients, we can drop the noise-contaminated detail coefficients to zero; thereby, removing the noise while preserving the signal.\n",
