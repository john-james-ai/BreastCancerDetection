Microcalcifications show up as fine, white specks, similar to grains of salt. Usually noncancerous, but certain patterns can be an early sign of cancer.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim for this section was to acquire insight into the CBIS-DDSM dataset and the factors that distinguish benign from malignant diagnoses in digital mammography screening. To that end, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were undertaken to understand how the data were distributed within the CBIS-DDSM dataset, to determine whether a statistical association exists between the features and between the features and the diagnosis, to evaluate how morphological features relate to a diagnosis and finally, to ascertain the relative importance of features to the classification task. Here we summarize the key findings from the analysis effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tApproximately 60% of the cases are benign, indicating a slight class imbalance which could lead to biased predictions.\n",
    "2.\tFor calcification cases, pleomorphic, amorphous, punctate, lucent-centered, and fine linear branching calcification types account for ~75% of the calcification case types.\n",
    "3.\tApproximately 85% of the calcification cases had either clustered or segmental classification distributions.\n",
    "4.\tFor mass cases, irregular, oval, lobulated, and round masses represented ~85% of all mass cases.\n",
    "5.\tThe five most frequently encountered mass margins: spiculated, circumscribed, ill-defined, obscured, and microlobulated, covered over 93% of the mass cases.\n",
    "6.\tThe majority (~70%) of cases have BI-RADS b and c breast densities, the remainder is evenly split between BI-RADS a and d densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature and Target Associations\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tOf the morphological features, mass margins had the strongest association with the diagnostic outcome. Ill-defined, microlobulated,  and spiculated margins were associated with the highest rates of malignancy.\n",
    "2.\tCalcification type was also strongly associated with pathology. Pleomorphic and fine linear branching were most highly associated with malignancy.\n",
    "3.\tCalcification distribution had a moderate effect on classification outcome. Linear calcification distributions had the highest rate of malignancy, followed by regional, and clustered distributions. Segmental and diffusely scattered distributions tended to indicate a benign pathology.\n",
    "4.\tSubtlety, image view, left-or-right side, and breast density were all weakly associated with the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThe three most important features for mass differential diagnoses were ill-defined, spiculated, and microlobulated mass margins. Lymph node, focal asymmetrical density, and asymmetric breast tissue were three mass shapes that had a strong, but lesser degree of importance than the mass margins.\n",
    "2.\tFor calcification cases, calcification type dominated the feature list in terms of importance. The top five included lucent-centered, punctate, amorphous, round and regular, and vascular calcification types.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes part 1 of the exploratory analysis. Next, we analyze the CBIS-DDSM imaging data."
