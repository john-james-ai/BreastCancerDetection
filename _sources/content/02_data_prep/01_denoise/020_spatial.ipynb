    "In spatial domain filtering, the value of a pixel is based upon both itself and the values of the surrounding pixels. Specifically, the output pixel value results from an algorithm that is applied to the values of the pixels in the neighborhood of a corresponding input pixel. Spatial domain filters are classified into two types: linear filters and non-linear filters.\n",

    "\n",
    "Linear filters are those in which the value of an output pixel is a linear combination of the values of the pixels in the input pixel’s neighborhood.  The filtering process is one of sliding a kernel, or mask of weights, along the image and performing a ‘multiple and accumulate’ operation (convolution) on the pixels covered by the mask. The effect is that the image pixel at the center of the mask is set to the weighted average of all the pixels in its *neighborhood*. The shape, and weights of the neighborhood are given by the kernel.\n",

Mean filtering simply replaces each pixel value with the average value of the intensities in its neighborhood. By doing so, the “sharp” transitions in the intensities are reduced.\n",

    "The Gaussian filter has several advantages:\n",

    "1. Easy to implement.\n",
    "2. Its’ Fourier transform is also a Gaussian distribution, centered around zero frequency. Its low-pass effectiveness can be controlled by adjusting its standard deviation.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Wiener Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wiener filter, introduced in a 1943 classified memo by Norbert Wiener, incorporates statistical characteristics of the signal and noise into the image restoration process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the Wiener filter is to take an input image, and then create an estimate of the true image such that the expected value of the squared difference between the estimate and the true image, is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wiener filter asserts the principle of orthogonality, which loosely states that the difference between the estimate and the input image, is uncorrelated with the input image. This means that the estimate is the projection of the input image onto the subspace spanned by the original image that minimizes the expected value of the error. From this, the filter computes a function that optimizes the trade-off between noise reduction, and signal distortion, by optimally attenuating the frequencies where the noise is dominant and preserving the frequencies where the signal is dominant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wiener filter has some nice properties. Since it is optimal in the mean-squared error sense, it can produce high-quality images where noise is minimized and fine detail is retained. Another advantage is that it adapts to changing characteristics of the signal and the noise, making it suitable for speech, image restoration, and other applications whereby the noise is unknown or varies in time and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, certain disadvantages limit its applicability and performance. For instance, the Wiener filter requires a priori knowledge of the degradation function and the power spectra for noise and signal, which may be difficult or impractical to obtain. Another disadvantage is that the Wiener filter can introduce artifacts, such as blurring and ringing due to smoothing in the frequency domain.\n",
    "Next, up? Non-linear filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Linear Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we examined filters in which the output was a linear combination of the input. For additive, independent noise, or that which follows a simple statistical pattern, linear filters will reduce noise to the extent that signal and noise can be separated in the frequency domain.  For multiplicative, noise (speckle) or signals with non-linear features (edges, lines) that must be preserved, non-linear methods will be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we explore four non-linear techniques widely used in biomedical imaging: median filter, adaptive median filter, non-local means filter, and bilateral filter.\n",

    "The bilateral filter has several advantages. It has a simple formulation: a pixel's value becomes the weighted average of the pixel values in its neighborhood. Consequently, its behavior can be understood intuitively and adapted to application-specific tasks. Another advantage is that the bilateral filter depends on only two parameters that specify the contrast and size of features to preserve. Therefore, it is easy to tune to application-specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "An aspect that limits the applicability of the bilateral filter is its computational complexity, $O(S^2)$, where $S$ is the number of pixels. With quadratic complexity, the computational cost increases sharply with image size.  can explode the computational cost. Yet, there is no dearth of optimizations proposed ({cite}`durandFastBilateralFiltering2002`,{cite}`eladOriginBilateralFilter2002`, {cite}`phamSeparableBilateralFiltering2005`, {cite}`parisFastApproximationBilateral2006`, {cite}`weissFastMedianBilateral2006a`), which reduce the computation cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation extends from one of its strengths. As mentioned, the bilateral filter considers the range of intensity values when computing the weights to apply. If a pixel value is too different from the values of neighboring pixels, it has less influence on the output. As a consequence, the bilateral filter is not the best filter for salt and pepper noise. Here, the difference between a pixel and its neighbors can span the entire range (e.g., 0-255 for 8-bit images). In such cases, the values are too different to influence the output. Several approaches have been proposed to improve its performance in such cases. An example involves mollification. Often, images containing extreme intensity gradients are mollified using a median filter first, to obtain an initial estimate. Then the bilateral filter is applied to produce a more precise final estimate.\n",

    "The use of the bilateral filter has grown rapidly since its introduction and is now ubiquitous in many image-processing applications.\n",

    "### Non-Local Means (NL-means) Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The bilateral filter above is pixel-based, in that the weights are based on the location and intensity similarity between individual pixels. The problem is that comparing only grey levels in a single pixel is not very robust when these values are noisy {cite}`buadesNonLocalAlgorithmImage2005`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NL-means algorithm {cite}`buadesNonLocalAlgorithmImage2005` extends neighborhood filtering algorithms, such as the bilateral filter, by comparing the similarity not of the individual pixels, but of the neighborhoods centered at the pixels. Somewhat informally, each pixel $i$, in a neighborhood $\\mathcal{N}_i$ of some fixed size $s$, is the weighted sum of the similarities between $\\mathcal{N}_i$ and every other neighborhood $\\mathcal{N}_j$ for $j\\in I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, let $v=\\{v(i) | i \\in I\\}$ be a noisy image, $i$, be a pixel in that image, and $\\mathcal{N}_i$ be a (square) neighborhood of size $s$ centered on pixel $i$, then the estimated value NL(v)(i), for pixel $i$, is:\n",

    "where the set of weights ${w(i,j)}_j$ depend on the similarity between the neighborhoods of pixel $i$, $\\mathcal{N}_i$ and pixel $j$, $\\mathcal{N}_j$,  and satisfy conditions $0 \\le w(i,j) \\le 1$ and $\\displaystyle\\sum_j w(i,j) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We describe the similarity between the neighborhoods $\\mathcal{N}_i$ and $\\mathcal{N}_j$ in terms of the intensity gray level vectors $v(\\mathcal{N}_i)$ and $v(\\mathcal{N}_j)$, where $\\mathcal{N}_k$ denotes a square neighborhood of fixed size and centered at pixel $k$.\n",

    "The similarity is measured as a decreasing function of the weighted Euclidean distance, $||v(\\mathcal{N}_i) - v(\\mathcal{N}_j)||^2_{2,\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha > 0$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel.\n",
    "Hence, the weights are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: nl_means_weights\n",
    "w(i,j) = \\frac{1}{Z(i)}e^{-\\frac{||v(\\mathcal{N}_i) - v(\\mathcal{N}_j)||^2_{2,\\alpha}}{h^2}},\n",

This has a computational complexity that is quadratic in the number of pixels in the image. In practice, the search for similar neighborhoods is often restricted to a search window centered on the pixel itself, instead of the whole image.\n",
