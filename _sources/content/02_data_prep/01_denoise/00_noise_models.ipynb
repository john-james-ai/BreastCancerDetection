    "# Noise Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, noise can be modeled as additive, multiplicative, or impulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additive Noise Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The additive noise model describes the abrupt, and undesired signal that gets added to an image, and is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: additive_noise_model\n",
    "f(x,y)=s(x,y)+n(x,y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the pixel to which the noise is applied;\n",
    "- $f(x,y)$ is the observed noisy image;\n",
    "- $s(x,y)$ is the noise-free image signal which has been corrupted by a noise process;\n",
    "- $n(x,y)$ is the signal-independent, random noise that is added to the original noise-free image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additive noise, the most common decomposition, can arise from numerous sources, including radiation scatter from the surface before the image is sensed; electrical noise in image sensors, random charge fluctuations induced by thermal noise, environmental electromagnetic interference, and noise associated with the acquisition system. However, dominant source of additive noise in X-ray mammography is the digitization process {cite}`bovikHandbookImageVideo2000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiplicative Noise Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplicative noise ({eq}`multiplicative_noise_model`), by contrast, refers to the unwanted random signal that gets *multiplied* into an image during signal capture, transmission, or other processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: multiplicative_noise_model\n",
    "f(x,y)=s(x,y)\\times n(x,y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the pixel to which the noise is applied;\n",
    "- $f(x,y)$ is the noisy image;\n",
    "- $s(x,y)$ is the noise-free image;\n",
    "- $n(x,y)$ refers to signal-dependent, random noise that is multiplied into $s(x,y)$ during image capture, transmission, storage or other processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas additive noise is signal independent, multiplicative noise is based on the value of the image pixel; whereby, the amount of noise multiplied into an image pixel is proportional to its intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can transform a multiplicative noise model to an additive noise model by taking the logarithm of both sides of the multiplication model. The additive model becomes multiplicative by exponentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, {eq}`multiplicative_noise_model` becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: log_mult_model\n",
    "\\text{log} f = \\text{log}(s_n) = \\text{log}(s) + \\text{log}(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, {eq}`additive_noise_model` becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: exp_add_model\n",
    "e^f = e^{s_n} = e^f e^n.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A common strategy for addressing multiplicative noise is to convert the noise in the image to additive noise, then apply an appropriate spatial domain filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Impulse Noise Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we have the impulse noise model, which represents a separate mathematical model, neither additive nor multiplicative. Impulse noise arises in the image as a consequence of signal transmission errors. Mathematically, we can describe impulse noise by the following equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: impulse\n",
    "{f(x,y)} = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "    s(x,y) & \\text{ with probability 1-P} \\\\\n",
    "    s(x,y) + n(x,y) & \\text{ with probability P}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $0 \\le P \\le 1$\n",
    "- $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the pixel to which the noise is applied;\n",
    "- $f(x,y)$ is the noisy image;\n",
    "- $s(x,y)$ is the noise-free image;\n",
    "- $n(x,y)$ refers random noise\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher values of $P$ correspond to greater levels of corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simplification of {eq}`impulse` for the case in which $n(x,y)$ replaces $s(x,y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: impulse_2\n",
    "{f(x,y)} = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "    s(x,y) & \\text{ with probability 1-P} \\\\\n",
    "    n(x,y) & \\text{ with probability P}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Impulse noise can be static or dynamic. In the case of static impulse noise, its pixel values get modified by only two values: either the low or high value in the range of pixel values. For instance, in an 8-bit grayscale image with values ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white), dark pixels corrupted by impulse noise would be replaced by 255, and white pixels would be replaced by 0. In the case of dynamic impulse noise, pixels are modified independently, with random values between 0 and 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we review the types of noise we may encounter."
