    "Image segmentation\n",
    "Segmentation is the process by which an image is partitioned into separate regions for the purposes of to detect and extract the region of interest (ROI), breast tissue containing one or more masses or calcifications. However, ROI detection and segmentation can be affected by pectoral muscles, text, and other artifacts which may cause over-segmentation, and lead to misclassification of breast tissue abnormalities. Below, four randomly selected mammogram images from the CBIS-DDSM dataset illustrate the challenge."

We'll be focusing on three classifications of image segmentation: threshold-based segmentation, edge-based segmentation, and region-based segmentation.\n",

    "- Edge-Based Segmentation (EBS) uses contours and gradients in the image to detect the edges surrounding one or more regions of interest. Canny Edge Detection, Active Contour, and Sobel segmentation are among the most common EBS methods.\n",
    "- Region-Based Segmentation (RBS) separates the image into regions with similar characteristics. The Watershed algorithm and certain morphological methods are prominent in this category.\n",

    "Weâ€™ll review the most prominent threshold-Based, edge-Based, and region-Based methods, evaluate their performance, and characterize their relative strengths, and shortcomings."
