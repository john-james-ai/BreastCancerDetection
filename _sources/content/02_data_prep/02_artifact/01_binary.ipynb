    "# Binary Masking\n",
    "\n",
    "In binary masking, each pixel in the binary mask has one of two values: ‘0’ representing the background, and ‘1’ or the maximum pixel intensity value i.e. ‘255’, corresponding to the image foreground. For the remainder of this discussion, we will use binary mask pixel values 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether the pixel value in the binary mask is assigned a 0 or 1 depends most often, on whether the associated image pixel value meets a designated or automatically selected threshold. Simply put, each pixel value $M_{i,j}$ in a binary mask $M$ is set to 0 if the corresponding pixel value $I_{i,j}$ in image $I$ is less than or equal to a threshold $T$, and set to 1 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: global_threshold\n",
    "M_{i,j} = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & \\text{if} I_{i,j} > T \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{if} I_{I,j} \\le T \\\\\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I$ denotes the image and $M$ indicates the binary mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting an appropriate threshold is critically important. One that is too low tends to merge too many image structures, and a threshold that is too high may remove important structural data from the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, let’s create a binary mask using threshold $T=127$."

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple binary mask {numref}`bm1_fig` shows how artifacts can be separated from the image; however, we lose detail in the breast tissue, indicating that our threshold is likely set to a value which is too high for this application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automated Thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "Manually selecting a threshold value is often suboptimal due to bias that may be introduced. In many cases, especially in biomedical imaging, we want the threshold $T$ to be set automatically such that the pixels in the region of interest correspond most optimally to the ‘1’ pixel, and those in the background correspond to the ‘0’ pixel values in the binary mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Literature is replete with automated binary threshold methods, most of which are based upon certain assumptions regarding the distribution of pixel values in the image. If the underlying assumptions about the image histogram shape or statistics are reasonably met, the methods perform very well; if not, the performance of the methods can range from acceptable to disasterous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated methods can be classified as either global thresholding or adaptive thresholding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global Thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "One obvious way of segmenting artifacts from an image is via global thresholding; whereby, a threshold $T$ is selected as a pixel value between the minimum and maximum pixel values in the image. If $T$ applies to the entire image, the process is referred to as **global thresholding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean thresholding provides an automated method for selecting a global threshold $T$ when the foreground and background regions are sufficiently distinct. For mean thresholding, the following iterative algorithm can serve this purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select an initial value for the global threshold $T$.\n",
    "2. Segment the image using $T$ in {eq}`global_threshold`  to produce two regions $G_1$ consisting of pixel values > $T$, and $G_2$ consisting of pixel values $\\le T$.\n",
    "3. Compute the mean intensity values $m_1$, and $m_2$ for the pixels in $G_1$ and $G_2$, respectively.\n",
    "4. Compute a new threshold $T$ midway between $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n",
    "5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 until the difference between successive values of $T$ is smaller than a predefined value, $\\Delta T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than computing these values iteratively, the image histogram can be used to more efficiently compute the global threshold $T$. Hence, the mean threshold method is often referred to as a **histogram shape-based** method. It tends to perform well for pixel values having a bimodal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine the binary mask created with Mean thresholding. We'll use the OpenCV 'cv2.adaptiveThreshold' method, which takes five parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The input image,\n",
    "2. The maximum pixel value,\n",
    "3. The adaptive threshold method, which can be:\n",
    "   - cv.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C\n",
    "   - cv.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C\n",
    "4. The neighborhood size parameter which specifies the size of the neighborhood around the target pixel from which the mean is calculated, and\n",
    "5. A constant C which is subtracted from the mean to compute the threshold $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the ADAPTIVE_MEAN_THRESH_C method with neighborhood size = 11 and $C=2$"
