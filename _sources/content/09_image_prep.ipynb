    "Precise and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer rests upon the discriminatory power of mathematical models designed to detect and classify structural abnormalities in breast tissue from biomedical imaging. Advances in artificial intelligence and computer vision, fueled by an explosion in AI task-specific computational power, have given rise to dense image recognition models capable of distinguishing increasingly complex patterns and structures in biomedical images. Still, the diagnostic performance and clinical applicability of such models rests upon the availability of large datasets containing high-quality, high-resolution images that are clear, sharp, and free of noise and artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory analysis of the CBIS-DDSM mammograph illuminated several issues that compromise the discriminatory power of image detection and recognition models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Various artifacts (large texts and annotations) are present within the mammography that resemble the pixel intensities of the regions of interest (ROIs), which can interfere with the ROI extraction process and/or lead to false diagnosis.\n",
    "- Noise of various types in the images is an obstacle to effective feature extraction, image detection, recognition, and classification.\n",
    "- Poor brightness and contrast levels in some mammograms may increase the influence of noise, and/or conceal important and subtle features.\n",
    "- Malignant tumors are characterized by irregular shapes and ambiguous or blurred edges that complicate the ROI segmentation task.\n",
    "- Dense breast tissue with pixel intensities similar to that of cancerous tissue, may conceal subtle structures of diagnostic importance.\n",
    "- Deep learning models for computer vision require large datasets. The CBIS-DDSM has just over 3500 full mammogram images, a relatively small dataset for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing these challenges is fundamentally important to model detection, recognition, and classification performance.\n",

    "## Image Preprocessing Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this regard, a five-stage image preprocessing approach ({numref}`image_prep`) has been devised to reduce noise in the images, eliminate artifacts, optimize image contrast and brightness, and produce a collection of images for maximally effective computer vision model training and classification.\n",

    "We begin with an evaluation of various denoising methods commonly applied to mammography. Once a denoising method and its (hyper) parameters are selected, we move to the artifact removal stage. Image binarizing and thresholding methods are evaluated, then morphological transformations are applied to the binarized images to remove artifacts. Next, the pectoral muscle is removed using various techniques such as Canny Edge Detection, Hough Lines Transformation, and Largest Contour Detection algorithms. To make malignant lesions more conspicuous during model training, we enhance image brightness and contrast with Gamma Correction and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is also added to improve the generalized performance of the neural network and mitigate model overfitting. Finally, we extract the ROIs using automated pixel intensity thresholding to create a binary mask which is applied to the enhanced images.\n",

    "## Denoise\n",
    "Mammography is inherently noisy. Image acquisition and transmission processes can inject unwanted and random signals (noise) into the image, which must be eliminated or minimized before downstream image processing. Here, noise is considered as the discrepancy between the true amount of light $s_i$ being measured at pixel $i$, and the corresponding measured pixel value $x_i$. This subsection aims to evaluate and select a function $f(x) \\approx s$ that takes a noisy image as input and returns an approximation of the true clean image as output.\n",

    "- Knowledge of the types of noises that may be encountered and the methods by which they manifests into the image.\n",
    "- Knowledge of the noise distribution within an image. We can use it to assess how likely a potential solution $s$ would give rise to $x$.\n",
    "- Knowledge of what clean images generally look like. For instance, we might expect an image to be smooth, and formally constrain the possible denoised outcome to have a certain \"smoothness\" probability distribution, called the *prior*\n",

    "### Noise Models\n",
    "Broadly speaking, biomedical image noise can be described as additive or multiplicative. Additive noise is the undesired signal that arises during data acquisition that gets added to an image.\n",
    "Signal processing theory defines an additive noise *model* given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: additive_noise_model\n",
    "f(x,y)=s(x,y)+n(x,y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the pixel to which the noise is applied;\n",
    "- $f(x,y)$ is the observed noisy image;\n",
    "- $s(x,y)$ is an unobserved, but deterministic, noise-free image signal which has been corrupted by a noise process;\n",
    "- $n(x,y)$ is the signal-independent, identically distributed, often zero-mean, random noise with variance $\\sigma^2_n$, that is added to the original noise-free image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the additive model describes an image as the pixel wise sum of an unobserved, noise-free image and random noise signal of the same shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplicative noise, by contrast, refers to the unwanted random signal that gets *multiplied* into an image during signal capture, transmission, or other processing. Similarly, we can define the multiplicative noise model as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: multiplicative_noise_model\n",
    "f(x,y)=s(x,y)\\times n(x,y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the pixel to which the noise is applied;\n",
    "- $f(x,y)$ is the noisy image;\n",
    "- $s(x,y)$ is the noise-free image;\n",
    "- $n(x,y)$ refers to signal-dependent, random noise that is multiplied into $s(x,y)$ during image capture, transmission, storage or other processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas additive noise is signal independent, multiplicative noise is based on the value of the image pixel; whereby, the amount of noise multiplied into an image pixel is proportional to its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing additive noise often involves some linear transformation into a space that separates the signal from the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The various additive and multiplicative noise types extant in mammography include Gaussian Noise, Quantization Noise, Poisson Noise, and Impulse Noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gaussian Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian noise is ubiquitous in signal processing, telecommunications systems, computer networks, statistical modeling and digital biomedical imaging. Principally, sources of Gaussian noise in digital imagery arise during data acquisition, and may derive from:\n",
    "\n",
    "- poor illumination during image capture;\n",
    "- image sensors subject to overheating or other disturbances caused by external factors;\n",
    "- interference in the transmission channel; or\n",
    "- random variations in the electrical signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian noise is additive in nature, signal independent, and assumed to be zero-mean. Yet, the defining characteristic of Gaussian noise is that it has a probability density function equal to that of the normal distribution, first introduced by French mathematician Abraham de Moivre in the second edition (1718) of his Doctrine of Chances {cite}`grattan-guinnessLandmarkWritingsWestern2005`, and later attributed to Karl Friedrich Gauss, a German mathematician, for his work connecting the method of least squares to the normal distribution {cite}`stiglerGaussInventionLeast1981`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, Gaussian noise may be expressed by the following bivariate isotropic (circular) Gaussian function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",

    "g(x,y)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_x\\sigma_y}e^-\\frac{[(x-\\mu_x)^2+(y-\\mu_y)^2]}{2\\sigma_x\\sigma_y}\n",

    "### Quantization Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization noise arises out of the Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) process. ADC consists of two steps: sampling and quantization. Sampling is the process of digitizing the coordinate values, $x$, and $y$, which defines the spatial resolution, or number of pixels of the digitized image. Quantization is the process of digitizing the amplitude or intensity values and determines the number of grey levels that each pixel can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization noise is an unavoidable aspect of ADC. An analog signal is continuous, with infinite accuracy, while the digital signal's accuracy depends upon the quantization resolution, or number of bits in the ADC. A common assumption is that quantization noise is additive, uniformly distributed and signal dependent, unless other noise sources are large enough to cause dithering, the addition of random noise to the pre-quantized signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Poisson Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "Image sensors measure scene irradiance by counting the number of discrete photons incident on the sensor over a given time interval. Since the detection of individual photons can be treated as independent events that follow a random temporal distribution, photon counting can be modeled as a Poisson process and the number of photons $N$ measured by given sensor element over some time interval $t$ can be described by the standard Poisson distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: poisson_pdf\n",
    "Pr(N=k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda t}(\\lambda t)^k}{k!}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is he expected number of photons per unit time interval. The uncertainty described by this distribution is known as photon noise, or Poisson noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the photon count follows a Poisson distribution, it has the property that the variance, $Var[N]$ is equal to the expectation, $E[N]$. This shows that photon noise is signal dependent and that the standard deviation grows with the square root of the signal.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "Image filtering techniques have broad applicability in biomedical image analysis and processing. In fact, most biomedical image analysis involves the application of image filtering at stages prerequisite to analysis. Fields such as signal processing, statistics, information theory, and computer vision have produced a considerable and growing body of research devoted to the design, development, and testing of filtering methods to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in audio, video, and imaging. While a systematic review of the denoising landscape is well beyond the scope of this effort, we will introduce the most commonly used filtering techniques used in denoising biomedical images, with a focus on applications in mammography.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this effort, we focus on five classes of filters commonly applied to the task of biomedical image noise reduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Filter**: Also known as the average filter,\n",
    "2. **Median Filter**: A non-linear noise reduction technique {cite}`arceNonlinearSignalProcessing2005`,\n",
    "3. **Gaussian Filter**: A linear noise reduction method based upon a Gaussian kernel {cite}`klapperResponseApproximationGaussian1959`,\n",
    "4. **Adaptive Median Filter**: Median filter with variable window size {cite}`hwangAdaptiveMedianFilters1995`, and\n",
    "5. **Non-Local Means Filter**: Filtering based upon non-local averaging of all pixels in the image {cite}`buadesNonLocalAlgorithmImage2005`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly used to reduce additive Gaussian noise, the mean filter is a simple, intuitive, and easy to implement, low-pass filter of the linear class. Low-pass filters, also known as smoothing or blurring filters, are The most basic of filtering operations is called \"low-pass\"\n",
    "Mean filtering simply replaces each pixel value with the average value of the intensities in its neighborhood. Usually thought of as a *convolutional filter*, mean filtering is based around the notion of a kernel, which represents the shape and size of the neighborhood to be sampled when computing the average intensities. Typically a 3x3 kernel is used; however, larger kernels (5x5, 7x7) can be used if greater smoothing is required.\n",
    "A kernel specifies the shape and size of the neighborhood to be sampled when computing the mean. Typically     Gaussian"
