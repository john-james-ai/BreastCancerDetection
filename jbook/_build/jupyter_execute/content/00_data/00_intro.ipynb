    "# **CBIS-DDSM** Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed in 1997 through a grant from the DOD Breast Cancer Research Program and the US Army Research and Material Command, the *original* Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) {cite}`USFDigitalMammography` is a collection of 2620 cases obtained by patient consent from Massachusetts General Hospital, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Sacred Heart Hospital, and Washington University of St. Louis School of Medicine. Its cases are annotated with ROIs for calcifications and masses, they include Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) descriptors for mass shape, mass margin, calcification type, calcification distribution, and breast density. They also include overall BI-RADS assessments from 0 to 5 and ratings of the subtlety of the abnormalities from 1 to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DDSM, a powerful and extensively used resource for imaging research, presented certain challenges that limited its accessibility and utility.  For instance, the original DDSM was saved in lossless JPEG files (LJPEG); a non-standard, and obsolete compression format. Regions of interest marked the general area of legions; but, lacked the specificity of precise image segmentation, requiring researchers to implement segmentation algorithms for accurate feature extraction. Some annotations marked legions that could not be seen. Further, the metadata processing and image correction routines distributed with the dataset were a set of bash and C routines that were difficult to refactor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM) {cite}`leeCuratedMammographyData2017` is an updated and standardized version of the original DDSM, developed to address some of the challenges. In particular, the questionable annotations were reimage_viewed by a trained mammographer, and 254 images were removed from the dataset. The images were converted from PVRG-JPEG to 8-bit raw binary bitmaps. Python tools were developed to convert the 8-bit images to 16-bit grayscale TIFF files, which were later converted to the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. The bash and C preprocessing tools were re-implemented in Python to be cross-platform. Convenience images were cropped around the region of interest for researchers analyzing only the abnormalities. Precise segmentation was applied to the calcification images providing much more accurate regions of interest, and the data were split into training and test sets, based on the BI-RADS category to support method evaluation and reproducibility.\n",

    "The CBIS-DDSM is comprised of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mammographic Images**: Full mammography, mammogram and cropped images {numref}`cbis_ddsm_images` ,\n",
    "- **Case Data**: Calcification and mass case data {numref}`cbis_ddsm_cases`\n",
    "- **Series Data**: Series, study and subject identifiers and image file locations.\n",
    "- **DICOM Metadata**: Image and modality information in DICOM imaging format.\n",
