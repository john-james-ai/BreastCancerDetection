    "# **CBIS-DDSM** Dataset\n",
    "Developed in 1997 through a grant from the DOD Breast Cancer Research Program and the US Army Research and Material Command, the *original* Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) {cite}`USFDigitalMammography` is a collection of 2620 cases obtained by patient consent from Massachusetts General Hospital, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Sacred Heart Hospital, and Washington University of St. Louis School of Medicine. Its cases are annotated with ROIs for calcifications and masses, they include Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) descriptors for mass shape, mass margin, calcification type, calcification distribution, and breast density. They also include overall BI-RADS assessments from 0 to 5 and ratings of the subtlety of the abnormalities from 1 to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DDSM, a powerful and extensively used resource for imaging research, presented certain challenges that limited its accessibility and utility.  For instance, the original DDSM was saved in lossless JPEG files (LJPEG); a non-standard, and obsolete compression format. Regions of interest marked the general area of legions; but, lacked the specificity of precise image segmentation, requiring researchers to implement segmentation algorithms for accurate feature extraction. Some annotations marked legions that could not be seen. Further, the metadata processing and image correction routines distributed with the dataset were a set of bash and C routines that were difficult to refactor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM) {cite}`leeCuratedMammographyData2017` is an updated and standardized version of the original DDSM, developed to address some of the challenges. In particular, the questionable annotations were reimage_viewed by a trained mammographer, and 254 images were removed from the dataset. The images were converted from PVRG-JPEG to 8-bit raw binary bitmaps. Python tools were developed to convert the 8-bit images to 16-bit grayscale TIFF files, which were later converted to DICOM. The bash and C preprocessing tools were re-implemented in Python to be cross-platform. Convenience images were cropped around the region of interest for researchers analyzing only the abnormalities. Precise segmentation was applied to the calcification images providing much more accurate regions of interest, and the data were split into training and test sets, based on the BI-RADS category to support method evaluation and reproducibility.\n",

    "CBIS-DDSM were obtained from the Cancer Imaging Archive {cite}`clarkCancerImagingArchive2013` and are summarized below:\n",

    "## Dataset Organization\n",
    "The CBIS-DDSM comprises mass and calcification case descriptive data, DICOM image data, and DICOM series metadata. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Case Descriptive Data\n",
    "Cases, defined by a particular abnormality seen on a cranial caudal (CC) or mediolateral oblique (MLO) image_view, are organized by BI-RADS categories: calcification and mass. Calcification and mass cases were further split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets of various levels of difficulty to support consistent evaluation of computer-aided diagnostics (CADx) systems. Their descriptions are contained in the following files.\n",

    "| Case | Mass-Training-Description | csv    |\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each case description file contains the following variables:\n",
    "- Patient ID\n",
    "- Density category\n",
    "- Breast: Left or Right\n",
    "- View: CC or MLO\n",
    "- Number of abnormality from the image.\n",
    "- Mass shape (when applicable)\n",
    "- Mass margin (when applicable)\n",
    "- Calcification type (when applicable)\n",
    "- Calcification distribution (when applicable)\n",
    "- BI-RADS assessment\n",
    "- Pathology: Benign, Benign without call-back, or Malignant\n",
    "- Subtlety rating: Radiologistsâ€™ rating of difficulty in image_viewing the abnormality in the image\n",
    "- Path to image files\n",
    "\n",
    "### DICOM Image Data\n",
    "As described above, the CBIS-DDSM contains full mammography, ROI mask, and cropped images in a directory structure organized by case. Each DICOM file comports with the DICOM standard and contains the image pixel data as well as image metadata such as:\n",
    "- SOP Class UID\n",
    "- SOP Instance UID\n",
    "- Content Date\n",

    "### DICOM Series Metadata\n",
    "A series encapsulates full mammography, ROI mask, or cropped images for a patient and image image_view. The DICOM Series Metadata file, 'metadata.csv', maps series metadata to DICOM image file location and contains the following attributes:\n",
    "- Series, subject, and study identifiers\n",
    "- Data description URL\n",
    "- Study dates and download timestamps\n",
    "- Series description, i.e. full mammogram image, ROI mask, or cropped image\n",
