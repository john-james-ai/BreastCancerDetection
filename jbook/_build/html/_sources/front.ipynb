    "### How to Use This Book\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the notebook locally, you will need to clone the repository, set up a virtual environment, and compile the jupyter book.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone Repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/john-james-ai/BreastCancerDetection) or by following the GitHub icon in the external link at the top of this page. Run the following in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/john-james-ai/BreastCancerDetection\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the download is complete, navigate to the root folder of the repository and create an environment from the `environment.yml` using the following command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compile the jupyter book:\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, compile the jupyter book with the following command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "jupyter-book build jbook/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The repository contains all metadata, raw and processed, for every image in the CBIS-DDSM. However, storing the 164 GB CBIS-DDSM *Imaging*  on GitHub was not a particularly serviceable option, so an experimental, 'mini' CBIS-DDSM was created from a 5% stratified random sample of the *full* CBIS-DDSM dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "All imaging analyses and exploration were conducted on this experimental dataset, which is also provided in the repository. {numref}`repo_data` outlines the file structure.\n",

    "That said, for those with larger appetites (and an extra 163 GB of available storage capacity), the CBIS-DDSM can be downloaded from [The Cancer Imaging Archive](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/cbis-ddsm/)(TCIA).  The images are downloaded using the [NBIA Data Retriever](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/NBIA/NBIA+Data+Retriever+Command-Line+Interface+Guide) which must be installed on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/NBIA/Downloading+TCIA+Images). Again, the CBIS-DDSM imaging data weighs in at over 163 GB, so download times may be considerable depending on your available internet bandwidth and throttling at TCIA.\n",
