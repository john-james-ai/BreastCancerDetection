    "# Frequency Domain Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, we think of an image as a rectangular array of pixels, each pixel representing an intensity at a position in the spatial domain. However, some operations are complicated, or impossible to perform in the spatial domain, and; therefore, a different representation is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his 1822 book, La Théorie Analitique de la Chaleur (The Analytic Theory of Heat) {cite}`fourierAnalyticalTheoryHeat2007`, French mathematician Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier, stated:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Any periodic function, no matter how complicated, can be expressed as the sum of sines and/or cosines of different frequencies, each multiplied by a different coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This non-intuitive idea was met with considerable skepticism; still, it gets even better. Fourier continues:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Functions that are not periodic, but have finite area under the curve, can be expressed as the integral of sines and/or cosines multiplied by a weighting function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formulation was called the Fourier transform and the important characteristic, perhaps **the** characteristic that propelled entire industries, reshaped academic disciplines and revolutionized the field of signal processing, states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A Function expressed as a Fourier transform can be reconstructed completely via an inverse transform with no loss of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we transform a signal from the spatial domain, work in the *Fourier domain* (now called the *frequency domain*), then return to the original domain without losing any information. This and the Fourier series allowed for the first time, practical processing of a range of signals of exceptional importance, from medical monitors, and scanners to modern telecommunications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "We convert an image from the spatial domain to a spectrum in the frequency domain via the *Discrete Fourier Transformation* (DFT) {cite}`fourierAnalyticalTheoryHeat2007`.  The DFT of an image $f(x,y)$ of size $M \\times N$ is an image $F$ of the same size and is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: dft\n",
    "F(u,v) = \\displaystyle\\sum_{x=0}^{M-1}\\displaystyle\\sum_{y=0}^{N-1} f(x,y)e^{-j2\\pi(\\frac{ux}{M}+\\frac{vy}{N})}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can convert an image back into the spatial domain using the *inverse* Discrete Fourier Transformation (IDFT), given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: dft_inv\n",
    "f(x,y) = \\frac{1}{MN}\\displaystyle\\sum_{u=0}^{M-1}\\displaystyle\\sum_{v=0}^{N-1} F(u,v)e^{+j2\\pi(\\frac{ux}{M}+\\frac{vy}{N})}\n",
    "```\n",
    "To get some intuition into the Fourier transform (FT) and the frequency domain representation, let’s plot a few FT images. In general, we plot the magnitude images and **not** the phase images [^phase].\n",
    "\n",
    "[^phase] The case reports of people who have studied phase images shortly thereafter succumbing to hallucinogenics or ending up in a Tibetan monastery {cite}`IntroductionFourierTransform`  have not been corroborated. Still, better safe…."

    "1. Given an input image $f(x,y)$ of size $M \\times N$, obtain the padding sizes $P=2M$ and $Q=2N$.\n",
    "2. Form a padded image $f_p(x,y)$ of size $P \\times Q$ using zero, mirror, or replicate padding.\n",
    "3. Shift $f_p(x,y)$ to center the Fourier transform on the  $P \\times Q$ frequency rectangle.\n",
    "4. Compute DFT, $F(u,v)$, of the shifted image $f_p(x,y)$.\n",
    "5. Construct the real symmetric filter transfer function, $H(u,v)$ of size $P \\times Q$ with center at ($P/2,Q/2).\n",
    "6. Perform the element-wise product $G(u,v)=H(u,v)F(u,v)$ for $i=0,1,2,..,M-1$ and $k=0,1,2,...,N-1$\n",
    "7. Obtain the frequency domain representation $g_p(x,y)$ by computing the IDFT of $G(u,v)$.\n",
    "8. Extract the filtered image of size $M \\times N$ from the top left quadrant of $g_p(x,y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will consider three types of frequency domain filters: the *ideal* filter, the Butterworth filter, and the Wavelet domain filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ideal Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The *ideal* filter attenuates unwanted frequencies from a signal while passing the wanted frequencies with uniform sensitivity. It has a ‘brick wall’ profile, in that the gain increases from zero at the stopband, to the higher gain of the passband at a single frequency. The ideal low-pass filter (ILPF) is defined by the following transfer function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: ideal_transfer\n",
    "H(u,v) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "    1 & if D(u,v) \\le D_0 \\\\\n",
    "    0 & if D(u,v) \\gt D_0\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D_0$ is a positive constant, and $D(u,v)$ is the distance between a point $(u,v)$ in the frequency domain and the origin of the $P \\times Q$ frequency rectangle; that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: ideal_distance\n",
    "D(u,v) = [(\\mu-P/2)^2 + (v-Q/2)^2]^{1/2}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P=2M$ and $Q=2N$ are the padded sizes of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "{numref}`ideal_filter` shows an ideal filter transfer function as an image. All frequencies on or inside the circle of radius $D_0$ are passed; whereas, all frequencies outside the circle are completely attenuated.\n",

    "\n",
    "The point of transition between the values $H(u,v)=1$ and $H(u,v)=0$ is called the *cutoff frequency*, the frequency at which the filter’s response drops off.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a variety of reasons, the ideal filter cannot be realized; however, its behavior can be studied via simulation. And a characteristic of the ideal filter is significant 'ringing', which occurs when the impulse response oscillates at sharp transitions in the step function and increases with the amount of high-frequency content that is passed. This is an unacceptable aspect, particularly in medical imaging where artifacts can affect clinical diagnoses and outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Butterworth low-pass filter which we will discuss next, avoids this phenomenon by decaying the impulse response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Butterworth Lowpass Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "A 1930 paper by Stephen Butterworth, a British engineer and physicist {cite}`ctx8685948790003821` showed that an ideal filter could be approximated by a low-pass filter whose cutoff frequency was normalized to 1 radian per second. The Butterworth filter has a flat passband and a more gradual transition to the stopband, which eliminates the ringing artifacts characteristic of the ideal low-pass filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Butterworth filter’s stopband begins at the cutoff frequency The roll-off rate, a measure of how quickly the filter’s response decreases as the frequency increases beyond the cutoff frequency, is controlled by the *order* of the filter. Higher order filters have a steeper roll-off rate, than lower order filters as shown in {numref}`butterworth_ideal`\n",

    "Ideal Frequency Response for a Butterworth Filter\n",
    "```\n",

    "Note that the higher-order filters come closer to the ‘ideal’ response. The transfer function of an $n^{th}$ order Butterworth filter is given as:\n",
    "\n",

    "H(u,v) = \\frac{1}{1+[D(u,v)/D_0]^{2n}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ represents the order of the filter, $D_0$ indicates the cutoff frequency at a distance $D_0$ from the origin, and $D(u,v)$ is given by {eq}`ideal_distance`. The spatial domain image obtained from the BLPF of order 1 has no ringing. At orders 2 and 3, ringing is imperceptible; however, ringing can be significant in filters of higher order."
