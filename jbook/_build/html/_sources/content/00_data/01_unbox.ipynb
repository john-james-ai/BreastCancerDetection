    "## Summary of Structural Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The data are currently split into train and test sets by BI-RADS category. While convenient for modeling, this is rather cumbersome for the exploratory data analysis which considers the entire dataset, before making any assumptions. As such, bringing the calcification and mass train and test sets together with the associated full mammogram image metadata into a single dataset will facilitate a top-down, comprehensive view of all the data for analysis.\n",
    "2. Our binary classification target variable can take one of three values: 'MALIGNANT', 'BENIGN', and 'BENIGN_WITHOUT_CALLBACK. The latter indicates that some aspect of the case is worth tracking; but, no follow-up is required. For our purposes, that is a distinction without a difference. Nonetheless, rather than modifying the variable and losing potentially useful information, we'll create a new target variable, 'cancer', which will be True if the pathology is 'MALIGNANT', and False otherwise.\n",
    "3. The CBIS-DDSM creators define a case as a particular abnormality as seen in the cranial-caudal (CC) or mediolateral oblique (MLO) image views; yet, there is no formal identification of a unique *mammogram*. A mammogram is defined here as a CC or MLO image of the left or right breast taken for a specific patient. Such a mammogram identifier would allow us to bring the case and the *full* mammogram imaging data together into a single dataset. ROI masks and cropped images are abnormality-level constructs and can remain as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this is an advocation for a single dataset containing only the information relevant to the analyses and modeling tasks. In the next section, a single task-specific dataset will be harvested from the CBIS-DDSM data."
