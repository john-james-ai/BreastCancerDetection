    "## Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this section was to conduct an exploratory data analysis of the CBIS-DDSM full mammogram imaging data. We evaluated image quality in terms of annotations, artifacts, and labeling in the dataset, inspected image resolutions, analyzed the distribution of pixel intensities vis-a-vis pathology, and visually characterized image texture and contrast for masses and calcifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this analysis, several key takeaways emerged:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Of the 3565 cases, approximately 40% of the training and test cases are malignant. Class imbalance can lead to biased predictions and degraded classification performance. Image augmentation techniques should be employed to mitigate bias introduced by class imbalance.\n",
    "2. Approximately 88% of the samples we examined had labeling, lines, and artifacts that must be removed during image preprocessing.\n",
    "3. Pectoral muscle, found in approximately 38% of the images sampled, shares some of the same visual characteristics of the dense region of interest and may compromise the classification performance of the convolutional neural network. Pectoral muscle removal will be an essential tasks in the image preprocessing workflow.\n",
    "4. An analysis of pixel intensities revealed that the average pixel values for malignant cases (M=14,025.57, SD=4620.74) was greater than that of the benign cases (M=12,762.52, SD=4,436.66). A student's t-test indicated the statistical significance (t(3563)=-8.15, p < 0.01) of this result.\n",
    "5. The CBIS-DDSM is comprised of high-resolution 16-bit images with aspect ratios ranging from 0.3 to 0.83. These images will be downsized to 256 x 256 pixels. Experimentation will determine whether to perform destructive resizing that changes the aspect ratio, or padded resizing in which the original aspect ratio is retained.\n",
    "6. Contrast enhancement must be encorporated into the preprocessing workflow to ensure that subtle masses and calcifications can be effectively distinguished from surrounding breast tissue as benign or malignant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes the exploratory data analysis of the CBIS-DDSM dataset. In this next section, we will build a modularized preprocessing module for denoising, artifact and pectoral removal,  contrast enhancement, and resizing."
