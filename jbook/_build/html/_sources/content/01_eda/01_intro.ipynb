    "\n",
    "In this section, we conduct an exploratory data analysis of the CBIS-DDSM dataset with several goals in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Maximize insight into the data and the factors that influence screening results in the CBIS-DDSM dataset.\n",
    "2. Assess the quality of the digital mammography in the CBIS-DDSM dataset.\n",
    "3. Select optimal methods and parameters for preprocessing tasks such as denoising and artifact removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploratory data analysis is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "{numref}`eda2` describes the structure and organization of the CBIS-DDSM dataset. {numref}`eda2` prepares the case and DICOM data for the analysis effort. {numref}`eda4` explores the case metadata for insights into screening and diagnosis of calcification and mass abnormalities in the dataset. {numref}`eda5` examines the quality and characteristics of the CBIS-DDSM images vis-Ã -vis abnormality type and morphological features of calcifications and masses. Finally, {numref}`eda6` evaluates methods and optimal parameter settings for preprocessing tasks such as denoising and artifact removal."
