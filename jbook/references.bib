Recent advances in machine learning, especially with regard to deep learning, are helping to identify, classify, and quantify patterns in medical images. At the core of these advances is the ability to exploit hierarchical feature representations learned solely from data, instead of features designed by hand according to domain-specific knowledge. Deep learning is rapidly becoming the state of the art, leading to enhanced performance in various medical applications. We introduce the fundamentals of deep learning methods and review their successes in image registration, detection of anatomical and cellular structures, tissue segmentation, computer-aided disease diagnosis and prognosis, and so on. We conclude by discussing research issues and suggesting future directions for further improvement.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women all over the world. Since the reason of breast cancer is unknown, early detection of the disease plays an important role in cancer control, saving lives and reducing costs. Among different modalities, automated 3-D breast ultrasound (3-D ABUS) is a new and effective imaging modality which has attracted a lot of interest as an adjunct to mammography for women with dense breasts. However, reading ABUS images is time consuming for radiologists and subtle abnormalities may be overlooked. Hence, computer aided detection (CADe) systems can be utilized as a second interpreter to assist radiologists to increase their screening speed and sensitivity. In this paper, a general architecture representing different CADe systems for ABUS images is introduced and the approaches for implementation of each block are categorized and reviewed. In addition, the limitations of these systems are discussed and their performance in terms of sensitivity and number of false positives per volume are compared.},

	abstract = {Background: Diagnosing breast cancer masses and calcification clusters have paramount significance in mammography, which aids in mitigating the disease’s complexities and curing it at early stages. However, a wrong mammogram interpretation may lead to an unnecessary biopsy of the false-positive findings, which reduces the patient’s survival chances. Consequently, approaches that learn to discern breast masses can reduce the number of misconceptions and incorrect diagnoses. Conventionally used classification models focus on feature extraction techniques specific to a particular problem based on domain information. Deep learning strategies are becoming promising alternatives to solve the many challenges of feature-based approaches. Methods: This study introduces a convolutional neural network (ConvNet)-based deep learning method to extract features at varying densities and discern mammography’s normal and suspected regions. Two different experiments were carried out to make an accurate diagnosis and classification. The first experiment consisted of five end-to-end pre-trained and fine-tuned deep convolution neural networks (DCNN). The in-depth features extracted from the ConvNet are also used to train the support vector machine algorithm to achieve excellent performance in the second experiment. Additionally, DCNN is the most frequently used image interpretation and classification method, including VGGNet, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, ResNet, and DenseNet. Moreover, this study pertains to data cleaning, preprocessing, and data augmentation, and improving mass recognition accuracy. The efficacy of all models is evaluated by training and testing three mammography datasets and has exhibited remarkable results. Results: Our deep learning ConvNet+SVM model obtained a discriminative training accuracy of 97.7\% and validating accuracy of 97.8\%, contrary to this, VGGNet16 method yielded 90.2\%, 93.5\% for VGGNet19, 63.4\% for GoogLeNet, 82.9\% for MobileNetV2, 75.1\% for ResNet50, and 72.9\% for DenseNet121. Conclusions: The proposed model’s improvement and validation are appropriated in conventional pathological practices that conceivably reduce the pathologist’s strain in predicting clinical outcomes by analyzing patients’ mammography images.},

	abstract = {Background: Identification and treatment of breast cancer at an early stage can reduce mortality. Currently, mammography is the most widely used effective imaging technique in breast cancer detection. However, an erroneous mammogram based interpretation may result in false diagnosis rate, as distinguishing cancerous masses from adjacent tissue is often complex and error-prone. Methods: Six pre-trained and fine-tuned deep CNN architectures: VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, DenseNet201, and InceptionV3 are evaluated to determine which model yields the best performance. We propose a BreastNet18 model using VGG16 as foundational base, since VGG16 performs with the highest accuracy. An ablation study is performed on BreastNet18, to evaluate its robustness and achieve the highest possible accuracy. Various image processing techniques with suitable parameter values are employed to remove artefacts and increase the image quality. A total dataset of 1442 preprocessed mammograms was augmented using seven augmentation techniques, resulting in a dataset of 11,536 images. To investigate possible overfitting issues, a k-fold cross validation is carried out. The model was then tested on noisy mammograms to evaluate its robustness. Results were compared with previous studies. Results: Proposed BreastNet18 model performed best with a training accuracy of 96.72\%, a validating accuracy of 97.91\%, and a test accuracy of 98.02\%. In contrast to this, VGGNet19 yielded test accuracy of 96.24\%, MobileNetV2 77.84\%, ResNet50 79.98\%, DenseNet201 86.92\%, and InceptionV3 76.87\%. Conclusions: Our proposed approach based on image processing, transfer learning, fine-tuning, and ablation study has demonstrated a high correct breast cancer classification while dealing with a limited number of complex medical images.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in Australia with crude incidence rates increasing drastically from 62.8 at ages 35-39 to 271.4 at ages 50-54 (cases per 100,000 women). Various researchers have proposed methods and tools based on Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks for assessing mammographic images, but these methods have produced detection and interpretation errors resulting in false-positive and false-negative cases when used in the real world. We believe that this problem can potentially be resolved by implementing effective image pre-processing techniques to create training data for Deep-CNN. Therefore, the main aim of this research is to propose effective image pre-processing methods to create datasets that can save computational time for the neural network and improve accuracy and classiﬁcation rates. To do so, this research proposes methods for background removal, pectoral muscle removal, adding noise to the images, and image enhancements. Adding noise without affecting the quality of details in the images makes the input images for the neural network more representative, which may improve the performance of the neural network model when used in the real world. The proposed method for background removal is the ‘‘Rolling Ball Algorithm’’ and ‘‘Huang’s Fuzzy Thresholding’’, which succeed in removing background from 100\% of the images. For pectoral muscle removal ‘‘Canny Edge Detection’’ and ‘‘Hough’s Line Transform’’ are used, which removed muscle from 99.06\% of the images. ‘‘Invert’’, ‘‘CTI\_RAS’’ and ‘‘ISOCONTOUR’’ lookup tables (LUTs) were used for image enhancements to outline the ROIs and regions within the ROIs.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women, behind only heart disease. However, despite the high incidence and mortality rates associated with breast cancer, it is still unclear as to what is responsible for its development in the first place. The prevention of breast cancer is not possible with any of the current available methods. Patients who are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer at an early stage have a better chance of having a successful treatment and recovery. In the field of breast cancer detection, digital mammography is widely acknowledged to be a highly effective method of detecting the disease early on. We may be able to improve early detection of breast cancer with the use of image processing techniques, thereby boosting our chances of survival and treatment success. This article discusses a breast cancer image processing and machine learning framework that was developed. The input data set for this framework is a sequence of mammography images, which are used as input data. The CLAHE approach is then utilized to improve the overall quality of the photographs by means of image processing. It is called contrast restricted adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), and it is an improvement on the original histogram equalization technique. This aids in the removal of noise from photographs while simultaneously improving picture quality. The segmentation of images is the next step in the framework’s development. An image is divided into distinct portions at this point because the pixels are labeled at this step. This assists in the identification of objects and the delineation of boundaries. To categorize these preprocessed images, techniques such as fuzzy SVM, Bayesian classifier, and random forest are employed, among others.},

In this study, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems were used to improve the image quality of mammography images and to detect suspicious areas. The main contribution of this study is to reveal the optimal combination of various pre-processing algorithms to enable better interpretation and classiﬁcation of mammography images because pre-processing algorithms signiﬁcantly affect the accuracy of segmentation and classiﬁcation methods. In this study, the effect of combinations of different preprocessing methods in differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions was investigated. All image processing algorithms used for lesion detection were used in the mini-MIAS database. In the ﬁrst step, label information and pectoral muscle resulting from the acquisition of mammography images were removed. In the second step, median ﬁlter (MF), contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), and unsharp masking (USM) algorithms with different combinations of the resolution and visibility of images are increased. In the third step, suspicious regions are extracted from the mammograms using the k-means clustering technique. Then, features were extracted from the obtained ROIs. Finally, feature datasets were classiﬁed as normal/abnormal, and benign/malign (two class classiﬁcation) using Machine Learning algorithms. Test performance measures of the classiﬁcation methods were examined. In both classiﬁcations made in the study, lower classiﬁcation performance values were obtained when the CLAHE algorithm was used alone as a pre-processing method compared to other pre-processing combinations. When the median ﬁlter and unsharp masking algorithms are added to the CLAHE algorithm, the performance of the classiﬁcation methods has increased. In terms of classiﬁcation success, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Neural Networks showed the best performance. It was found by comparing the performances of the classiﬁcation methods that different preprocessing algorithms were effective in detecting the presence of breast lesions and distinguishing benign and malignant.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is widespread worldwide and can be cured if diagnosed early. Using digital mammogram images and image processing with artiﬁcial intelligence can play an essential role in breast cancer diagnosis. As many computerized algorithms for breast cancer diagnosis have signiﬁcant limitations, such as noise handling and varying or low contrast in the images, it can be difﬁcult to segment the abnormal region. These challenges could be overcome by proposing a new preprocessing model, exploring its impact on the post-processing module, and testing it on an extensive database. In this research work, the three-step method is proposed and validated on large databases of mammography images. The ﬁrst step corresponded to the database classiﬁcation, followed by the second step, which removed the pectoral muscle from the mammogram image. The third stage utilized new image-enhancement techniques and a new segmentation module to detect abnormal regions in a well-enhanced image to diagnose breast cancer. The pre-and post-processing modules are based on novel image processing techniques. The proposed method was tested using data collected from different hospitals in the Qassim Health Cluster, Qassim Province, Saudi Arabia. This database contained the ﬁve categories in the Breast Imaging and Reporting and Data System and consisted of 2892 images; the proposed method is analyzed using the publicly available Mammographic Image Analysis Society database, which contained 322 images. The proposed method gives good contrast enhancement with peak-signal to noise ratio improvement of 3 dB. The proposed method provides an accuracy of approximately 92\% on 2892 images of Qassim Health Cluster, Qassim Province, Saudi Arabia. The proposed method gives approximately 97\% on the Mammographic Image Analysis Society database. The novelty of the proposed work is that it could work on all Breast Imaging and Reporting and Data System categories. The performance of the proposed method demonstrated its ability to improve the diagnostic performance of the computerized breast cancer detection method.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES To curate, annotate, and make publicly available a large-scale data set of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images to facilitate the development and evaluation of artificial intelligence algorithms for breast cancer screening; to develop a baseline deep learning model for breast cancer detection; and to test this model using the data set to serve as a baseline for future research. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this diagnostic study, 16 802 DBT examinations with at least 1 reconstruction view available, performed between August 26, 2014, and January 29, 2018, were obtained from Duke Health System and analyzed. From the initial cohort, examinations were divided into 4 groups and split into training and test sets for the development and evaluation of a deep learning model. Images with foreign objects or spot compression views were excluded. Data analysis was conducted from January 2018 to October 2020. EXPOSURES Screening DBT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The detection algorithm was evaluated with breast-based free-response receiver operating characteristic curve and sensitivity at 2 false positives per volume.
RESULTS The curated data set contained 22 032 reconstructed DBT volumes that belonged to 5610 studies from 5060 patients with a mean (SD) age of 55 (11) years and 5059 (100.0\%) women. This included 4 groups of studies: (1) 5129 (91.4\%) normal studies; (2) 280 (5.0\%) actionable studies, for which where additional imaging was needed but no biopsy was performed; (3) 112 (2.0\%) benign biopsied studies; and (4) 89 studies (1.6\%) with cancer. Our data set included masses and architectural distortions that were annotated by 2 experienced radiologists. Our deep learning model reached breast-based sensitivity of 65\% (39 of 60; 95\% CI, 56\%-74\%) at 2 false positives per DBT volume on a test set of 460 examinations from 418 patients.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The large, diverse, and curated data set presented in this study could facilitate the development and evaluation of artificial intelligence algorithms for breast cancer screening by providing data for training as well as a common set of cases for model validation. The performance of the model developed in this study showed that the task remains challenging; its performance could serve as a baseline for future model development.},

	abstract = {Background: The limitations of traditional computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for mammography, the extreme importance of early detection of breast cancer and the high impact of the false diagnosis of patients drive researchers to investigate deep learning (DL) methods for mammograms (MGs). Recent breakthroughs in DL, in particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable advances in the medical fields. Specifically, CNNs are used in mammography for lesion localization and detection, risk assessment, image retrieval, and classification tasks. CNNs also help radiologists providing more accurate diagnosis by delivering precise quantitative analysis of suspicious lesions.
Results: In this survey, we conducted a detailed review of the strengths, limitations, and performance of the most recent CNNs applications in analyzing MG images. It summarizes 83 research studies for applying CNNs on various tasks in mammography. It focuses on finding the best practices used in these research studies to improve the diagnosis accuracy. This survey also provides a deep insight into the architecture of CNNs used for various tasks. Furthermore, it describes the most common publicly available MG repositories and highlights their main features and strengths.
Conclusions: The mammography research community can utilize this survey as a basis for their current and future studies. The given comparison among common publicly available MG repositories guides the community to select the most appropriate database for their application(s). Moreover, this survey lists the best practices that improve the performance of CNNs including the pre-processing of images and the use of multi-view images. In addition, other listed techniques like transfer learning (TL), data augmentation, batch normalization, and dropout are appealing solutions to reduce overfitting and increase the generalization of the CNN models. Finally, this survey identifies the research challenges and directions that require further investigations by the community.},

It then presents and discusses the literature on available mammography training datasets. The survey then presents and discusses current literature on CNNs for four distinct mammography tasks: (1) breast density classification, (2) breast asymmetry detection and classification, (3) calcification detection and classification, and (4) mass detection and classification, including presenting and comparing the reported quantitative results for each task and the pros and cons of the different CNN-based approaches. Then, it offers real-world applications of CNN CAD algorithms by discussing current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved models. Finally, this survey highlights the potential opportunities for future work in this field.

	abstract = {Early breast cancer detection is one of the most important issues that need to be addressed worldwide as it can help increase the survival rate of patients. Mammograms have been used to detect breast cancer in the early stages; if detected in the early stages, it can drastically reduce treatment costs. The detection of tumours in the breast depends on segmentation techniques. Segmentation plays a significant role in image analysis and includes detection, feature extraction, classification, and treatment. Segmentation helps physicians quantify the volume of tissue in the breast for treatment planning. In this work, we have grouped segmentation methods into three groups: classical segmentation that includes region-, threshold-, and edge-based segmentation; machine learning segmentation; and supervised and unsupervised and deep learning segmentation. The findings of our study revealed that region-based segmentation is frequently used for classical methods, and the most frequently used techniques are region growing. Further, a median filter is a robust tool for removing noise. Moreover, the MIAS database is frequently used in classical segmentation methods. Meanwhile, in machine learning segmentation, unsupervised machine learning methods are more frequently used, and U-Net is frequently used for mammogram image segmentation because it does not require many annotated images compared with other deep learning models. Furthermore, reviewed papers revealed that it is possible to train a deep learning model without performing any preprocessing or postprocessing and also showed that the U-Net model is frequently used for mammogram segmentation. The U-Net model is frequently used because it does not require many annotated images and also because of the presence of high-performance GPU computing, which makes it easy to train networks with more layers. Additionally, we identified mammograms and utilised widely used databases, wherein 3 and 28 are public and private databases, respectively.},

Deep convolutional networks have become a promising approach in segmenting ABUS images. However, designing an effective network architecture is time-consuming, and highly relies on specialist’s experience and prior knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce a searchable segmentation network (denoted as Auto-DenseUNet) based on the neural architecture search (NAS) to search the optimal architecture automatically for the ABUS mass segmentation task. Concretely, a novel search space is designed based on a densely connected structure to enhance the gradient and information flows throughout the network. Then, to encourage multiscale information fusion, a set of searchable multiscale aggregation nodes between the down-sampling and up-sampling parts of the network are further designed. Thus, all the operators within the dense connection structure or between any two aggregation nodes can be searched to find the optimal structure. Finally, a novel decoupled search training strategy during architecture search is also introduced to alleviate the memory limitation caused by continuous relaxation in NAS. The proposed Auto-DeseUNet method has been evaluated on our ABUS dataset with 170 volumes (from 107 patients), including 120 training volumes and 50 testing volumes split at patient level. Experimental results on testing volumes show that our searched architecture performed better than several human-designed segmentation models on the 3D ABUS mass segmentation task, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of breast caner detection from multi-view mammograms. We present a novel cross-view attention module (CvAM) which implicitly learns to focus on the cancerrelated local abnormal regions and highlighting salient features by exploring cross-view information among four views of a screening mammography exam, e.g. asymmetries between left and right breasts and lesion correspondence between two views of the same breast. More speciﬁcally, the proposed CvAM calculates spatial attention maps based on the same view of different breasts to enhance bilateral asymmetric regions, and channel attention maps based on two different views of the same breast to enhance the feature channels corresponding to the same lesion in a single breast. CvAMs can be easily integrated into standard convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures such as ResNet to form a multi-view classiﬁcation model. Experiments are conducted on DDSM dataset, and results show that CvAMs can not only provide better classiﬁcation accuracy over non-attention and single-view attention models, but also demonstrate better abnormality localization power using CNN visualization tools.},

	abstract = {Mammography is one of the most commonly applied tools for early breast cancer screening. Automatic segmentation of breast masses in mammograms is essential but challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the wide variety of mass shapes and sizes. Existing methods deal with these challenges mainly by extracting mass-centered image patches manually or automatically. However, manual patch extraction is time-consuming and automatic patch extraction brings errors that could not be compensated in the following segmentation step. In this study, we propose a novel attention-guided dense-upsampling network (AUNet) for accurate breast mass segmentation in whole mammograms directly. In AUNet, we employ an asymmetrical encoder–decoder structure and propose an effective upsampling block, attention-guided dense-upsampling block (AU block). Especially, the AU block is designed to have three merits. Firstly, it compensates the information loss of bilinear upsampling by dense upsampling. Secondly, it designs a more effective method to fuse high- and low-level features. Thirdly, it includes a channel-attention function to highlight rich-information channels. We evaluated the proposed method on two publicly available datasets, CBIS-DDSM and INbreast. Compared to three state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks, AUNet achieved the best performances with an average Dice similarity coefficient of 81.8\% for CBIS-DDSM and 79.1\% for INbreast.},

	abstract = {Screening for breast cancer with mammography has been introduced in various countries over the last 30 years, initially using analog screen-film-based systems and, over the last 20 years, transitioning to the use of fully digital systems. With the introduction of digitization, the computer interpretation of images has been a subject of intense interest, resulting in the introduction of computer-aided detection (CADe) and diagnosis (CADx) algo­ rithms in the early 2000′s. Although they were introduced with high expectations, the potential improvement in the clinical realm failed to materialize, mostly due to the high number of false positive marks per analyzed image. In the last five years, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in computing, driven mostly by deep learning and convolutional neural networks, has also pervaded the field of automated breast cancer detection in digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis. Research in this area first involved comparison of its capabil­ ities to that of conventional CADe/CADx methods, which quickly demonstrated the potential of this new tech­ nology. In the last couple of years, more mature and some commercial products have been developed, and studies of their performance compared to that of experienced breast radiologists are showing that these algorithms are on par with human-performance levels in retrospective data sets. Although additional studies, especially pro­ spective evaluations performed in the real screening environment, are needed, it is becoming clear that AI will have an important role in the future breast cancer screening realm. Exactly how this new player will shape this field remains to be determined, but recent studies are already evaluating different options for implementation of this technology.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate visually and quantitatively the performance of a deep-learning-based super-resolution (SR) model for microcalcifications in digital mammography.
Method: Mammograms were consecutively collected from 5080 patients who underwent breast cancer screening from January 2015 to March 2017. Of these, 93 patients (136 breasts, mean age, 50 ± 7 years) had micro­ calcifications in their breasts on mammograms. We applied an artificial intelligence model known as a fast SR convolutional neural network to the mammograms. SR and original mammograms were visually evaluated by four breast radiologists using a 5-point scale (1: original mammograms are strongly preferred, 5: SR mammo­ grams are strongly preferred) for the detection, diagnostic quality, contrast, sharpness, and noise of micro­ calcifications. Mammograms were quantitatively evaluated using a perception-based image-quality evaluator (PIQE).
Results: All radiologists rated the SR mammograms better than the original ones in terms of detection, diagnostic quality, contrast, and sharpness of microcalcifications. These ratings were significantly different according to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p {\textless}.001), while the noise score of the three radiologists was significantly lower (p {\textless}.001). According to PIQE, SR mammograms were rated better than the original mammograms, showing a significant difference by paired t-test (p {\textless}.001).
Conclusion: An SR model based on deep learning can improve the visibility of microcalcifications in mammog­ raphy and help detect and diagnose them in mammograms.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Breast cancer is the cancer with the highest incidence in women, and early detection can effectively improve the survival rate of patients. Mammography is an important method for physicians to screening breast cancer, but the diagnosis of mammograms by physicians depends largely on clinical practice experience. Studies have shown that using computer-aided diagnosis techniques can help doctors diagnose breast cancer.
Methods: In this paper, the method of convolutional neural network is mainly used to classify benign and malignant breast masses in the mammograms. First, we use multi-scale residual networks and densely connected networks as backbone networks to extract the features of global image patches and local image patches. Second, we use the attention module named convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to improve the two feature extraction networks to enhance the network’s feature expression ability. Finally, we fuse the features of multi-scale image patches to achieve the classification of benign and malignant breast masses.
Results: In the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM) database, the accuracy, sensitivity, AUC value and corresponding standard deviation of our method are 0.9626 Æ 0.0110, 0.9719 Æ 0.0126, and 0.9576 Æ 0.0064, respectively. Compared with the commonly used ResNet (AUC = 0.8823 Æ 0.0112) and DenseNet (AUC = 0.9141 Æ 0.0085), the performance of our method has improved. In addition, we also used the INbreast database to train and validate the proposed method. The accuracy, sensitivity, AUC and corresponding standard deviations are 0.9554 Æ 0.0296, 0.9605 Æ 0.0228, and 0.9468 Æ 0.0085, respectively.
Conclusions: Compared with the previous work, our proposed method uses multi-scale image features, has better classification performance in breast mass patches classification tasks, and can effectively assist physicians in breast cancer diagnosis. © 2021 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14942]},

	abstract = {Breast tumor is one of the most prominent indicators for the diagnosis of breast cancer. The precise segmentation of tumors is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of breast cancer detection. A physician’s assessment of the MRI scan is time-consuming and require a lot of human effort and expertise. Furthermore, traditional medical segmentation approaches frequently need prior information or manual feature extraction, resulting in a subjective diagnosis. Therefore, the development of an automated image segmentation approach is essential for clinical applications. This work presents BTS-GAN, an automatic breast tumor segmentation process using conditional GAN (cGAN) in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. First, we used an encoder-decoder deep network with skip connections between encoder and decoder for the generator to increase the localization efﬁciency. Second, we utilized a parallel dilated convolution (PDC) module to retain the features of various sizes of masses and to effectively extract information about the masses’ edges and interior texture. Third, an extra classiﬁcation-related constraint is included to the loss function of the cGAN for mitigating the hard-to-converge challenge in image-toimage (I2I) translation tasks based on classiﬁcation. The generator side of our proposed model learns to detect the tumor and construct a binary mask, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between ground truth and synthetic masks, driving the generator to produce masks as genuine as possible. The experimental results demonstrate that our BTS-GAN is more efﬁcient and reliable for breast tumor segmentation and outperform other segmentation techniques in terms of the IoU and Dice coefﬁcient on the publicly available RIDER breast cancer MRI dataset. Our proposed model achieved an average IoU and Dice scores of 77\% and 85\% respectively.},

	abstract = {Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging breast cancer screening and diagnostic modality that uses quasi-three-dimensional breast images to provide detailed assessments of the dense tissue within the breast. In this study, a framework of a 3D-Mask region-based convolutional neural network (3D-Mask RCNN) computeraided diagnosis (CAD) system was developed for mass detection and segmentation with a comparative analysis of performance on patient subgroups with different clinicopathological characteristics. To this end, 364 samples of DBT data were used and separated into a training dataset (n = 201) and a testing dataset (n = 163). The detection and segmentation results were evaluated on the testing set and on subgroups of patients with different characteristics, including different age ranges, lesion sizes, histological types, lesion shapes and breast densities. The results of our 3D-Mask RCNN framework were compared with those of the 2D-Mask RCNN and Faster RCNN methods. For lesion-based mass detection, the sensitivity of 3D-Mask RCNN-based CAD was 90\% with 0.8 false positives (FPs) per lesion, whereas the sensitivity of the 2D-Mask RCNN- and Faster RCNN-based CAD was 90\% at 1.3 and 2.37 FPs/lesion, respectively. For breast-based mass detection, the 3D-Mask RCNN generated a sensitivity of 90\% at 0.83 FPs/breast, and this framework is better than the 2D-Mask RCNN and Faster RCNN, which generated a sensitivity of 90\% with 1.24 and 2.38 FPs/breast, respectively. Additionally, the 3D-Mask RCNN achieved signiﬁcantly (p {\textless} 0.05) better performance than the 2D methods on subgroups of samples with characteristics of ages ranged from 40 to 49 years, malignant tumors, spiculate and irregular masses and dense breast, respectively. Lesion segmentation using the 3DMask RCNN achieved an average precision (AP) of 0.934 and a false negative rate (FNR) of 0.053, which are better than those achieved by the 2D methods. The results suggest that the 3D-Mask RCNN CAD framework has advantages over 2D-based mass detection on both the whole data and subgroups with different characteristics.},

Early detection of breast cancer can improve survival rates to a great extent. Inter-observer and intra-observer errors occur frequently in analysis of medical images, given the high variability between interpretations of different radiologists. Also, the sensitivity of mammographic screening varies with image quality and expertise of the radiologist. So, there is no golden standard for the screening process. To offset this variability and to standardize the diagnostic procedures, efforts are being made to develop automated techniques for diagnosis and grading of breast cancer images. A few papers have documented the general trend of computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer, making a broad study of the several techniques involved. But, there is no deﬁnitive documentation focusing on the mathematical techniques used in breast cancer detection. This review aims at providing an overview about recent advances and developments in the ﬁeld of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) of breast cancer using mammograms, speciﬁcally focusing on the mathematical aspects of the same, aiming to act as a mathematical primer for intermediates and experts in the ﬁeld.},

Regardless of improvement of imaging technology, accurate segmentation of the breast boundary and detection of the pectoral muscle are still challenging tasks for image processing algorithms. In this paper, we discuss problems related to mammographic image preprocessing and accurate segmentation. We review specific methods that were commonly used in most of the techniques proposed for segmentation of mammograms and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Comparative analysis of the methods reported on is made difficult by variations in the datasets and procedures of evaluation used by the authors. We attempt to overcome some of these limitations by trying to compare methods which used the same dataset and have some similarities in approaches to the breast boundary segmentation and detection of the pectoral muscle. In this paper, we will address the most often used methods for segmentation such as thresholding, morphology, region growing, active contours, and wavelet filtering. These methods, or their combinations, are the ones most used in the last decade by the majority of work published in this image processing domain.},

              The rapid development of deep learning, a family of machine learning techniques, has spurred much interest in its application to medical imaging problems. Here, we develop a deep learning algorithm that can accurately detect breast cancer on screening mammograms using an “end-to-end” training approach that efficiently leverages training datasets with either complete clinical annotation or only the cancer status (label) of the whole image. In this approach, lesion annotations are required only in the initial training stage, and subsequent stages require only image-level labels, eliminating the reliance on rarely available lesion annotations. Our all convolutional network method for classifying screening mammograms attained excellent performance in comparison with previous methods. On an independent test set of digitized film mammograms from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM), the best single model achieved a per-image AUC of 0.88, and four-model averaging improved the AUC to 0.91 (sensitivity: 86.1\%, specificity: 80.1\%). On an independent test set of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images from the INbreast database, the best single model achieved a per-image AUC of 0.95, and four-model averaging improved the AUC to 0.98 (sensitivity: 86.7\%, specificity: 96.1\%). We also demonstrate that a whole image classifier trained using our end-to-end approach on the CBIS-DDSM digitized film mammograms can be transferred to INbreast FFDM images using only a subset of the INbreast data for fine-tuning and without further reliance on the availability of lesion annotations. These findings show that automatic deep learning methods can be readily trained to attain high accuracy on heterogeneous mammography platforms, and hold tremendous promise for improving clinical tools to reduce false positive and false negative screening mammography results.

	abstract = {Mammography can be considered as the current gold standard for detecting early signs of breast cancer and is in wide use throughout the world. As conﬁrmed by many studies, breast cancer screening using mammography can reduce breast cancer-related mortality by 30–70\%. However, although the interpretation of mammography images by a second reader has been shown to increase the cancer detection rate, this practice is not widespread due to the cost associated. As a result, computer-aided detection/diagnosis (CAD) of breast mammography has been gaining popularity with various studies illustrating the positive effects of using computers in detecting early breast cancer signs by providing the radiologists with a second opinion with most of these CAD systems requiring the breast outline and pectoral muscle regions (in images acquired using Medio-Lateral-Oblique view) to be segmented from mammograms prior to the classiﬁcation. This paper discusses recent developments and methods proposed for segmenting the breast and pectoral muscle regions and compares the performance and shortcomings of different approaches grouped together based on the techniques used. While it is arduous to compare these methods using comparative analysis, a set of common performance evaluation criterion is deﬁned in this study and various methods are compared based on their methodology and the validation dataset used. Although many methods can achieve promising results, there is still room for further development, especially in pre-processing and image enhancement steps where most methods do not take the necessary steps for ensuring a smooth segmentation of boundaries. In this paper, the most effective pre-processing, image enhancement and segmentation concepts proposed for breast boundary and pectoral muscle segmentation are identiﬁed and discussed in hopes of aiding the readers with identifying the best possible solutions for these segmentation problems.},

Optimistically, there is a good chance of recovery from breast cancer if identiﬁed and treated at an early stage. Therefore, several researchers have established deep-learningbased automated methods for their efﬁciency and accuracy in predicting the growth of cancer cells utilizing medical imaging modalities. As of yet, few review studies on breast cancer diagnosis are available that summarize some existing studies. However, these studies were unable to address emerging architectures and modalities in breast cancer diagnosis. This review focuses on the evolving architectures of deep learning for breast cancer detection. In what follows, this survey presents existing deep-learning-based architectures, analyzes the strengths and limitations of the existing studies, examines the used datasets, and reviews image pre-processing techniques. Furthermore, a concrete review of diverse imaging modalities, performance metrics and results, challenges, and research directions for future researchers is presented.},

To detect breast cancer, various imaging modalities can be used, such as mammography. Computer-Aided Detection/Diagnosis (CAD) systems can assist an expert radiologist to diagnose breast cancer at an early stage. This paper introduces the findings of a systematic review that seeks to examine the state-of-the-art CAD systems for breast cancer detection. This review is based on 118 publications published in 2018–2021 and retrieved from major scientific publication databases while using a rigorous methodology of a systematic review. We provide a general description and analysis of existing CAD systems that use machine learning methods as well as their current state based on mammogram image modalities and classification methods. This systematic review presents all stages of CAD including preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. We identify research gaps and outline recom­ mendations for future research. This systematic review may be helpful for both clinicians, who use CAD systems for early diag­ nosis of breast cancer, as well as for researchers to find knowl­ edge gaps and create more contributions for breast cancer diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most common death causes amongst women all over the world. Early detection of breast cancer plays a critical role in increasing the survival rate. Various imaging modalities, such as mammography, breast MRI, ultrasound and thermography, are used to detect breast cancer. Though there is a considerable success with mammography in biomedical imaging, detecting suspicious areas remains a challenge because, due to the manual examination and variations in shape, size, other mass morphological features, mammography accuracy changes with the density of the breast. Furthermore, going through the analysis of many mammograms per day can be a tedious task for radiologists and practitioners. One of the main objectives of biomedical imaging is to provide radiologists and practitioners with tools to help them identify all suspicious regions in a given image. Computer-aided mass detection in mammograms can serve as a second opinion tool to help radiologists avoid running into oversight errors. The scientiﬁc community has made much progress in this topic, and several approaches have been proposed along the way. Following a bottom-up narrative, this paper surveys different scientiﬁc methodologies and techniques to detect suspicious regions in mammograms spanning from methods based on low-level image features to the most recent novelties in AI-based approaches. Both theoretical and practical grounds are provided across the paper sections to highlight the pros and cons of different methodologies. The paper’s main scope is to let readers embark on a journey through a fully comprehensive description of techniques, strategies and datasets on the topic.},

This paper aims to review articles that extracted texture features from mammograms and used those features along with machine learning algorithms to assess breast cancer risk. Besides that, deep learning methodologies that aimed for the same goal were also reviewed. In this work, ﬁrst, a brief introduction to breast cancer statistics and screening programs is presented; after that, research done in the ﬁeld of breast cancer risk assessment are analyzed, in terms of both methodologies used and results obtained. Finally, considerations about the analyzed papers are conducted. The results of this review allow to conclude that both machine and deep learning methodologies provide promising results in the ﬁeld of risk analysis, either in a stratiﬁcation in risk groups, or in a prediction of a risk score.

	abstract = {This work explores the use of characterization features extracted based on breast-mass contours obtained by automated segmentation methods, for the classification of masses in mammograms according to their diagnosis (benign or malignant). Two sets of mass contours were obtained via two segmentation methods (a dynamic-programming-based method and a constrained region-growing method), and simplified versions of these contours (modeling the contours as ellipses) were employed to extract a set of six features designed for characterization of mass margins (contrast between foreground region and background region, coefficient of variation of edge strength, two measures of the fuzziness of mass margins, a measure of spiculation based on relative gradient orientation, and a measure of spiculation based on edge-signature information). Three popular classifiers (Bayesian classifier, Fisher's linear discriminant, and a support vector machine) were then used to predict the diagnosis of a set of 349 masses based on each of said features and some combinations of these. The systems (each system consists of a segmentation method, a featureset, and a classifier) were compared with each other in terms of their performance on the diagnosis of the set of breast masses. It was found that, although there was a percent difference of about 14\% in the average segmentation quality between methods, this was translated into an average percent difference of only 4\% in the classification performance. It was also observed that the spiculation feature based on edgesignature information was distinctly better than the rest of the features, although it is not very robust to changes in the quality of the segmentation. All systems were more efficient in predicting the diagnosis of benign masses than that of the malignant masses, resulting in low sensitivity and high specificity values (e.g. 0.6 and 0.8, respectively) since the positive class in the classification experiments is the set of malignant masses. It was concluded that features extracted from automated contours can contribute to the diagnosis of breast masses in screening programs by correctly identifying a majority of benign masses. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Large margin classiﬁers like the support vector machine (SVM) have been reported effective in computer-assisted diagnosis systems for breast cancers. However, since the separating hyperplane determination exclusively relies on support vectors, the SVM is essentially a local classiﬁer and its performance can be further improved. In this work, we introduce a structured SVM model to determine if each mammographic region is normal or cancerous by considering the cluster structures in the training set. The optimization problem in this new model can be solved efﬁciently by being formulated as one second order cone programming problem. Experimental evaluation is performed on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) dataset. Various types of features, including curvilinear features, texture features, Gabor features, and multi-resolution features, are extracted from the sample images. We then select the salient features using the recursive feature elimination algorithm. The structured SVM achieves better detection performance compared with a well-tested SVM classiﬁer in terms of the area under the ROC curve.},

Efforts in computer vision have been made in order to help improving the diagnostic accuracy by radiologists. In this paper, we present a methodology that uses Moran's index and Geary's coefficient measures in breast tissues extracted from mammogram images. These measures are used as input features for a support vector machine classifier with the purpose of distinguishing tissues between normal and abnormal cases as well as classifying them into benign and malignant cancerous cases. The use of both proposed techniques showed to be very promising, since we obtained an accuracy of 96.04\% and Az ROC of 0.946 with Geary's coefficient and an accuracy of 99.39\% and Az ROC of 1 with Moran's index to discriminate tissues in mammograms as normal or abnormal.

Research eﬀorts have reported with increasing conﬁrmation that the support vector machines (SVM) have greater accurate diagnosis ability. In this paper, breast cancer diagnosis based on a SVM-based method combined with feature selection has been proposed. Experiments have been conducted on diﬀerent training-test partitions of the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset (WBCD), which is commonly used among researchers who use machine learning methods for breast cancer diagnosis. The performance of the method is evaluated using classiﬁcation accuracy, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive and negative predictive values, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and confusion matrix. The results show that the highest classiﬁcation accuracy (99.51\%) is obtained for the SVM model that contains ﬁve features, and this is very promising compared to the previously reported results.},

The secret of setting up the accurate diagnosis is to detect and understand the most subtle signs of breast lesions. Analysis of asymmetry between the left and right mammograms can provide clues about the presence of early signs of tumors. In this work we present an automated procedure for bilateral asymmetry detection composed of the following steps: (1) mammography density analysis and ﬁbro-glandular disc detection through adaptive clustering techniques, (2) analysis and implementation of bilateral asymmetries detection algorithms based on Gabor ﬁlters analysis, (3) use of a linear Bayes classiﬁer with the leave-one-out method to asses the asymmetry degree of the two breasts, (4) metrological evaluation of the whole system through random and systematic measurement uncertainty contributions modeling.},

	abstract = {The most common form of cancer among women in both developed and developing countries is breast cancer. The early detection and diagnosis of this disease is significant because it may reduce the number of deaths caused by breast cancer and improve the quality of life of those effected. Computer-aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods have shown promise in recent years for aiding in the human expert reading analysis and improving the accuracy and reproducibility of pathology results. One significant application of CADe and CADx is for breast cancer screening using mammograms. In image processing and machine learning research, relevant results have been produced by sparse analysis methods to represent and recognize imaging patterns. However, application of sparse analysis techniques to the biomedical field is challenging, as the objects of interest may be obscured because of contrast limitations or background tissues, and their appearance may change because of anatomical variability. We introduce methods for label-specific and label-consistent dictionary learning to improve the separation of benign breast masses from malignant breast masses in mammograms. We integrated these approaches into our Spatially Localized Ensemble Sparse Analysis (SLESA) methodology. We performed 10- and 30-fold cross validation (CV) experiments on multiple mammography datasets to measure the classification performance of our methodology and compared it to deep learning models and conventional sparse representation. Results from these experiments show the potential of this methodology for separation of malignant from benign masses as a part of a breast cancer screening workflow.},

	abstract = {Background:  Mammography is one of the most popular tools for early detection of breast cancer. Contour of breast mass in mammography is very important information to distinguish benign and malignant mass. Contour of benign mass is smooth and round or oval, while malignant mass has irregular shape and spiculated contour. Several studies have shown that 1D signature translated from 2D contour can describe the contour features well.
Methods:  In this paper, we propose a new method to translate 2D contour of breast mass in mammography into 1D signature. The method can describe not only the contour features but also the regularity of breast mass. Then we segment the whole 1D signature into different subsections. We extract four local features including a new contour descriptor from the subsections. The new contour descriptor is root mean square (RMS) slope. It can describe the roughness of the contour. KNN, SVM and ANN classifier are used to classify benign breast mass and malignant mass.
Results:  The proposed method is tested on a set with 323 contours including 143 benign masses and 180 malignant ones from digital database of screening mammography (DDSM). The best accuracy of classification is 99.66\% using the feature of root mean square slope with SVM classifier.
Conclusion:  The performance of the proposed method is better than traditional method. In addition, RMS slope is an effective feature comparable to most of the existing features.},

The existing computer aided diagnosis (CAD) methods used to beneﬁt a lot from low-level or middle-level features which are not that good at the simulation of real diagnostic processes, adding difﬁculties in improving the classiﬁcation performance. In this paper, we design a deep feature based framework for breast mass classiﬁcation task. It mainly contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a decision mechanism. Combining intensity information and deep features automatically extracted by the trained CNN from the original image, our proposed method could better simulate the diagnostic procedure operated by doctors and achieved state-of-art performance. In this framework, doctors' global and local impressions left by mass images were represented by deep features extracted from two different layers called high-level and middle-level features. Meanwhile, the original images were regarded as detailed descriptions of the breast mass. Then, classiﬁers based on features above were used in combination to predict classes of test images. And outcomes of classiﬁers based on different features were analyzed jointly to determine the types of test images. With the help of two kinds of feature visualization methods, deep features extracted from different layers illustrate effective in classiﬁcation performance and diagnosis simulation. In addition, our method was applied to DDSM dataset and achieved high accuracy under two objective evaluation measures.},

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method that automatically learns features based directly on the optmisation of breast mass classiﬁcation from mammograms, where we target an improved classiﬁcation performance compared to the approach described above. The novelty of our approach lies in the two-step training process that involves a pre-training based on the learning of a regressor that estimates the values of a large set of handcrafted features, followed by a ﬁne-tuning stage that learns the breast mass classiﬁer. Using the publicly available INbreast dataset, we show that the proposed method produces better classiﬁcation results, compared with the machine learning model using hand-crafted features and with deep learning method trained directly for the classiﬁcation stage without the pre-training stage. We also show that the proposed method produces the current state-of-the-art breast mass classiﬁcation results for the INbreast dataset. Finally, we integrate the proposed classiﬁer into a fully automated breast mass detection and segmentation, which shows promising results.},

Under this model, detection of groups is performed in hierarchically organized layers while each layer represents a scope for target objects. The processing of these layers involves sequential extraction of appearance features for an individual object, consistency measurement features for nearby objects, and ﬁnally the distribution features for all objects within the group. Using the concept of scope-based normalization, the extracted features not only enhance local contrast of an individual object, but also provide consistent characterization for all related objects. As an example, a microcalciﬁcation group detection system for 2D mammography was developed, and then the learned model was transferred to 3D digital breast tomosynthesis without any retraining or ﬁne-tuning. The detection system demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and detected 96\% of cancerous lesions at the rate of 1.2 false positives per volume as measured on an independent tomosynthesis test set.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Mammographic breast density is an established risk marker for breast cancer and is visually assessed by radiologists in routine mammogram image reading, using four qualitative Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS) breast density categories. It is particularly difficult for radiologists to consistently distinguish the two most common and most variably assigned BIRADS categories, i.e., “scattered density” and “heterogeneously dense”. The aim of this work was to investigate a deep learning-based breast density classifier to consistently distinguish these two categories, aiming at providing a potential computerized tool to assist radiologists in assigning a BIRADS category in current clinical workflow.
Methods: In this study, we constructed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model coupled with a large (i.e., 22,000 images) digital mammogram imaging dataset to evaluate the classification performance between the two aforementioned breast density categories. All images were collected from a cohort of 1,427 women who underwent standard digital mammography screening from 2005 to 2016 at our institution. The truths of the density categories were based on standard clinical assessment made by board-certified breast imaging radiologists. Effects of direct training from scratch solely using digital mammogram images and transfer learning of a pretrained model on a large nonmedical imaging dataset were evaluated for the specific task of breast density classification. In order to measure the classification performance, the CNN classifier was also tested on a refined version of the mammogram image dataset by removing some potentially inaccurately labeled images. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to measure the accuracy of the classifier.
Results: The AUC was 0.9421 when the CNN-model was trained from scratch on our own mammogram images, and the accuracy increased gradually along with an increased size of training samples. Using the pretrained model followed by a fine-tuning process with as few as 500 mammogram images led to an AUC of 0.9265. After removing the potentially inaccurately labeled images, AUC was increased to 0.9882 and 0.9857 for without and with the pretrained model, respectively, both significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.001) than when using the full imaging dataset.
Conclusions: Our study demonstrated high classification accuracies between two difficult to distinguish breast density categories that are routinely assessed by radiologists. We anticipate that our approach will help enhance current clinical assessment of breast density and better support consistent density notification to patients in breast cancer screening. © 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.12683]},

	abstract = {Background and objective: Radiologists often have a hard time classifying mammography mass lesions which leads to unnecessary breast biopsies to remove suspicions and this ends up adding exorbitant expenses to an already burdened patient and health care system.
Methods: In this paper we developed a Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) system based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that aims to help the radiologist classify mammography mass lesions. Deep learning usually requires large datasets to train networks of a certain depth from scratch. Transfer learning is an effective method to deal with relatively small datasets as in the case of medical images, although it can be tricky as we can easily start overﬁtting.
Results: In this work, we explore the importance of transfer learning and we experimentally determine the best ﬁne-tuning strategy to adopt when training a CNN model. We were able to successfully ﬁne-tune some of the recent, most powerful CNNs and achieved better results compared to other state-of-the-art methods which classiﬁed the same public datasets. For instance we achieved 97.35\% accuracy and 0.98 AUC on the DDSM database, 95.50\% accuracy and 0.97 AUC on the INbreast database and 96.67\% accuracy and 0.96 AUC on the BCDR database. Furthermore, after pre-processing and normalizing all the extracted Regions of Interest (ROIs) from the full mammograms, we merged all the datasets to build one large set of images and used it to ﬁne-tune our CNNs. The CNN model which achieved the best results, a 98.94\% accuracy, was used as a baseline to build the Breast Cancer Screening Framework. To evaluate the proposed CAD system and its eﬃciency to classify new images, we tested it on an independent database (MIAS) and got 98.23\% accuracy and 0.99 AUC.
Conclusion: The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed framework is performant and can indeed be used to predict if the mass lesions are benign or malignant. © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The percentage of mammographic dense tissue (PD) is an important risk factor for breast cancer, and there is some evidence that texture features may further improve predictive ability. However, relatively little work has assessed or validated textural feature algorithms using raw full field digital mammograms (FFDM).
Method: A case-control study nested within a screening cohort (age 46–73 years) from Manchester UK was used to develop a texture feature risk score (264 cases diagnosed at the same time as mammogram of the contralateral breast, 787 controls) using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method for 112 features, and validated in a second case-control study from the same cohort but with cases diagnosed after the index mammogram (317 cases, 931 controls). Predictive ability was assessed using deviance and matched concordance index (mC). The ability to improve risk estimation beyond percent volumetric density (Volpara) was evaluated using conditional logistic regression.
Results: The strongest features identified in the training set were “sum average” based on the grey-level co-occurrence matrix at low image resolutions (original resolution 10.628 pixels per mm; downsized by factors of 16, 32 and 64), which had a better deviance and mC than volumetric PD. In the validation study, the risk score combining the three sum average features achieved a better deviance than volumetric PD (Δχ2 = 10.55 or 6.95 if logarithm PD) and a similar mC to volumetric PD (0.58 and 0.57, respectively). The risk score added independent information to volumetric PD (Δχ2 = 14.38, p = 0.0008).
Conclusion: Textural features based on digital mammograms improve risk assessment beyond volumetric percentage density. The features and risk score developed need further investigation in other settings.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07047},
	abstract = {Advances in deep learning for natural images have prompted a surge of interest in applying similar techniques to medical images. The majority of the initial attempts focused on replacing the input of a deep convolutional neural network with a medical image, which does not take into consideration the fundamental differences between these two types of images. Speciﬁcally, ﬁne details are necessary for detection in medical images, unlike in natural images where coarse structures matter most. This difference makes it inadequate to use the existing network architectures developed for natural images, because they work on heavily downscaled images to reduce the memory requirements. This hides details necessary to make accurate predictions. Additionally, a single exam in medical imaging often comes with a set of views which must be fused in order to reach a correct conclusion. In our work, we propose to use a multi-view deep convolutional neural network that handles a set of high-resolution medical images. We evaluate it on largescale mammography-based breast cancer screening (BI-RADS prediction) using 886,000 images. We focus on investigating the impact of the training set size and image size on the prediction accuracy. Our results highlight that performance increases with the size of training set, and that the best performance can only be achieved using the original resolution. In the reader study, performed on a random subset of the test set, we conﬁrmed the efﬁcacy of our model, which achieved performance comparable to a committee of radiologists when presented with the same data.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: Automatic detection and classiﬁcation of the masses in mammograms are still a big challenge and play a crucial role to assist radiologists for accurate diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system based on one of the regional deep learning techniques, a ROI-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is called You Only Look Once (YOLO). Although most previous studies only deal with classiﬁcation of masses, our proposed YOLO-based CAD system can handle detection and classiﬁcation simultaneously in one framework.
Methods: The proposed CAD system contains four main stages: preprocessing of mammograms, feature extraction utilizing deep convolutional networks, mass detection with conﬁdence, and ﬁnally mass classiﬁcation using Fully Connected Neural Networks (FC-NNs). In this study, we utilized original 600 mammograms from Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and their augmented mammograms of 2,400 with the information of the masses and their types in training and testing our CAD. The trained YOLO-based CAD system detects the masses and then classiﬁes their types into benign or malignant.
Results: Our results with ﬁve-fold cross validation tests show that the proposed CAD system detects the mass location with an overall accuracy of 99.7\%. The system also distinguishes between benign and malignant lesions with an overall accuracy of 97\%.
Conclusions: Our proposed system even works on some challenging breast cancer cases where the masses exist over the pectoral muscles or dense regions.},

In this paper, the calcification was characterized by descriptors obtained from deep learning and handcrafted descriptors. We compared the performances of different image feature sets on digital mammograms. The feature sets included the deep features alone, the handcrafted features, their combination, and the filtered deep features. Experimental results have demonstrated that the deep features outperform handcrafted features, but the handcrafted features can provide complementary information for deep features.

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate two deep learning-based modeling schemes for predicting short-term risk of developing breast cancer using prior normal screening digital mammograms in a case-control setting.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective Institutional Review Board-approved study on a case-control cohort of 226 patients (including 113 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 113 controls) who underwent general population breast cancer screening. For each patient, a prior normal (i.e., with negative or benign findings) digital mammogram examination [including mediolateral oblique (MLO) view and craniocaudal (CC) view two images] was collected. Thus, a total of 452 normal images (226 MLO view images and 226 CC view images) of this case-control cohort were analyzed to predict the outcome, i.e., developing breast cancer (cancer cases) or remaining breast cancer-free (controls) within the follow-up period. We implemented an end-to-end deep learning model and a GoogLeNet-LDA model and compared their effects in several experimental settings using two mammographic view images and inputting two different subregions of the images to the models. The proposed models were also compared to logistic regression modeling of mammographic breast density. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as the model performance metric.
Results: The highest AUC was 0.73 [95\% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.68–0.78; GoogLeNet-LDA model on CC view] when using the whole-breast and was 0.72 (95\% CI: 0.67–0.76; GoogLeNetLDA model on MLO + CC view) when using the dense tissue, respectively, as the model input. The GoogleNet-LDA model significantly (all P {\textless} 0.05) outperformed the end-to-end GoogLeNet model in all experiments. CC view was consistently more predictive than MLO view in both deep learning models, regardless of the input subregions. Both models exhibited superior performance than the percent breast density (AUC = 0.54; 95\% CI: 0.49–0.59).
Conclusions: The proposed deep learning modeling approach can predict short-term breast cancer risk using normal screening mammogram images. Larger studies are needed to further reveal the promise of deep learning in enhancing imaging-based breast cancer risk assessment. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13886]},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the malignant tumor that causes the highest number of cancer deaths in females. Digital mammograms (DM or 2D mammogram) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT or 3D mammogram) are the two types of mammography imagery that are used in clinical practice for breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Radiologists usually read both imaging modalities in combination; however, existing computer-aided diagnosis tools are designed using only one imaging modality. Inspired by clinical practice, we propose an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for breast cancer classiﬁcation, which uses both 2D and 3D mammograms, simultaneously. Our experiment shows that the proposed method signiﬁcantly improves the performance of breast cancer classiﬁcation. By assembling three CNN classiﬁers, the proposed model achieves 0.97 AUC, which is 34.72\% higher than the methods using only one imaging modality.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed solid cancers. Mammography is the most commonly used screening technology for detecting breast cancer. Traditional machine learning methods of mammographic image classiﬁcation or segmentation using manual features require a great quantity of manual segmentation annotation data to train the model and test the results. But manual labeling is expensive, time-consuming, and laborious, and greatly increases the cost of system construction. To reduce this cost and the workload of radiologists, an end-to-end full-image mammogram classiﬁcation method based on deep neural networks was proposed for classiﬁer building, which can be constructed without bounding boxes or mask ground truth label of training data. The only label required in this method is the classiﬁcation of mammographic images, which can be relatively easy to collect from diagnostic reports. Because breast lesions usually take up a fraction of the total area visualized in the mammographic image, we propose different pooling structures for convolutional neural networks(CNNs) instead of the common pooling methods, which divide the image into regions and select the few with high probability of malignancy as the representation of the whole mammographic image. The proposed pooling structures can be applied on most CNN-based models, which may greatly improve the models’ performance on mammographic image data with the same input. Experimental results on the publicly available INbreast dataset and CBIS dataset indicate that the proposed pooling structures perform satisfactorily on mammographic image data compared with previous stateof-the-art mammographic image classiﬁers and detection algorithm using segmentation annotations.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the second deadliest cancer among women. Mammography is an important method for physicians to diagnose breast cancer. The main purpose of this study is to use deep learning to automatically classify breast masses in mammograms into benign and malignant. This study proposes a two-view mammograms classiﬁcation model consisting of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), which is used to classify benign and malignant breast masses. The model is composed of two branch networks, and two modiﬁed ResNet are used to extract breast-mass features of mammograms from craniocaudal (CC) view and mediolateral oblique (MLO) view, respectively. In order to effectively utilise the spatial relationship of the two-view mammograms, gate recurrent unit (GRU) structures of RNN is used to fuse the features of the breast mass from the two-view. The digital database for screening mammography (DDSM) be used for training and testing our model. The experimental results show that the classiﬁcation accuracy, recall and area under curve (AUC) of our method reach 0.947, 0.941 and 0.968, respectively. Compared with previous studies, our method has signiﬁcantly improved the performance of benign and malignant classiﬁcation.},

	abstract = {The diagnosis of breast cancer in early stage is essential for successful treatment. Detection can be performed in several ways, the most common being through mammograms. The projections acquired by this type of examination are directly affected by the composition of the breast, which density can be similar to the suspicious masses, being a challenge the identification of malignant lesions. In this article, we propose a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to aid in the diagnosis of masses in digitized mammograms using a model based in the U-Net, allowing specialists to monitor the lesion over time. Unlike most of the studies, we propose the use of an entire base of digitized mammograms using normal, benign, and malignant cases. Our research is divided into four stages: (1) pre-processing, with the removal of irrelevant information, enhancement of the contrast of 7989 images of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM), and obtaining regions of interest. (2) Data augmentation, with horizontal mirroring, zooming, and resizing of images; (3) training, with tests of six-based U-Net models, with different characteristics; (4) testing, evaluating four metrics, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Dice Index. The tested models obtained different results regarding the assessed parameters. The best model achieved a sensitivity of 92.32\%, specificity of 80.47\%, accuracy of 85.95\% Dice Index of 79.39\%, and AUC of 86.40\%. Even using a full base without case selection bias, the results obtained demonstrate that the use of a complete database can provide knowledge to the CAD expert.},

Early detection of breast cancer, followed by appropriate treatment, can reduce the risk of death from this disease. DL through CNN can assist imaging specialists in classifying the mammograms accurately. Accurate classification of mammograms using CNN needs a well-trained CNN by a large number of labeled mammograms. Unfortunately, a large number of labeled mammograms are not always available. In this study, a novel procedure to aid imaging specialists in detecting normal and abnormal mammograms has been proposed. The procedure supplied the designed CNN with a cheat sheet for some classical attributes extracted from the ROI and an extra number of labeled mammograms through data augmentation. The cheat sheet aided the CNN through encoding easy-to-recognize artificial patterns in the mammogram before passing it to the CNN, and the data augmentation supported the CNN with more labeled data points. Fifteen runs of 4 different modified datasets taken from the MIAS dataset were conducted and analyzed. The results showed that the cheat sheet, along with data augmentation, enhanced CNN’s accuracy by at least 12.2\% and enhanced the precision of the CNN by at least 2.2. The mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained using the proposed procedure were 92.1, 91.4, and 96.8, respectively, while the average area under the ROC curve was 94.9.},

	abstract = {Data scarcity and class imbalance are two fundamental challenges in many machine learning applications to healthcare. Breast cancer classiﬁcation in mammography exempliﬁes these challenges, with a malignancy rate of around 0.5\% in a screening population, which is compounded by the relatively small size of lesions (∼1\% of the image) in malignant cases. Simultaneously, the prevalence of screening mammography creates a potential abundance of non-cancer exams to use for training. Altogether, these characteristics lead to overﬁtting on cancer cases, while under-utilizing non-cancer data. Here, we present a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) model for data augmentation that can realistically synthesize and remove lesions on mammograms. With self-attention and semi-supervised learning components, the U-net-based architecture can generate high resolution (256x256px) outputs, as necessary for mammography. When augmenting the original training set with the GAN-generated samples, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant improvement in malignancy classiﬁcation performance on a test set of real mammogram patches. Overall, the empirical results of our algorithm and the relevance to other medical imaging paradigms point to potentially fruitful further applications.},

            We aimed to predict molecular subtypes of breast cancer using radiomics signatures extracted from synthetic mammography reconstructed from digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). A total of 365 patients with invasive breast cancer with three different molecular subtypes (luminal A + B, luminal; HER2-positive, HER2; triple-negative, TN) were assigned to the training set and temporally independent validation cohort. A total of 129 radiomics features were extracted from synthetic mammograms. The radiomics signature was built using the elastic-net approach. Clinical features included patient age, lesion size and image features assessed by radiologists. In the validation cohort, the radiomics signature yielded an AUC of 0.838, 0.556, and 0.645 for the TN, HER2 and luminal subtypes, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, the radiomics signature was the only independent predictor of the molecular subtype. The combination of the radiomics signature and clinical features showed significantly higher AUC values than clinical features only for distinguishing the TN subtype. In conclusion, the radiomics signature showed high performance for distinguishing TN breast cancer. Radiomics signatures may serve as biomarkers for TN breast cancer and may help to determine the direction of treatment for these patients.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Breast mass segmentation is a prerequisite step in the use of computer-aided tools designed for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. However, mass segmentation remains challenging due to the low contrast, irregular shapes, and fuzzy boundaries of masses. In this work, we propose a mammography mass segmentation model for improving segmentation performance.
Methods: We propose a mammography mass segmentation model called SAP-cGAN, which is based on an improved conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). We introduce a superpixel average pooling layer into the cGAN decoder, which utilizes superpixels as a pooling layout to improve boundary segmentation. In addition, we adopt a multiscale input strategy to enable the network to learn scale-invariant features with increased robustness. The performance of the model is evaluated with two public datasets: CBIS-DDSM and INbreast. Moreover, ablation analysis is conducted to evaluate further the individual contribution of each block to the performance of the network.
Results: Dice and Jaccard scores of 93.37\% and 87.57\%, respectively, are obtained for the CBISDDSM dataset. The Dice and Jaccard scores for the INbreast dataset are 91.54\% and 84.40\%, respectively. These results indicate that our proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art breast mass segmentation methods. The superpixel average pooling layer and multiscale input strategy has improved the Dice and Jaccard scores of the original cGAN by 7.8\% and 12.79\%, respectively.
Conclusions: Adversarial learning with the addition of a superpixel average pooling layer and multiscale input strategy can encourage the Generator network to generate masks with increased realism and improve breast mass segmentation performance through the minimax game between the Generator network and Discriminator network. © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14671]},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is now widely known to be the second most lethal disease among women. Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems, deep learning (DL) in particular, have continued to provide significant computa­ tional solution in early detection and diagnosis of this disease. Research efforts are advancing novel approaches to improve the performance of DL-based models. Techniques such as data augmentation, varying depth of model, image quality enhancement, and choice of classifier have been proposed to improve performance in the char­ acterization of abnormalities in mammograms. However, no significant progress has been made in applying deep learning techniques to the detection of architectural distortion – a form of abnormalities in breast images. In this research, we propose a novel convolution neural network (CNN) model for the detection of architectural distortion by enhancing its performance using data augmentation technique. We also investigate the performance of the proposed model on different operations of image augmentation. Furthermore, the new model was adapted to detect images presenting the right and left breast presented in MLO and CC views. Similarly, we investigate the performance of our model under the fixed-size region of interests (ROIs) and multi-size whole images inputs. Our method was trained on 5136 ROIs from MIAS, 410 whole images from INbreast, 322 whole images from MIAS, and 55,890 ROIs from DDSM + CBS databases. Performance evaluation of the proposed model in comparison with other state-of-the-art techniques revealed that the model achieved 93.75 \% accuracy. This study has, therefore, strengthened the need to leverage data augmentation techniques to enhance the detection of archi­ tectural distortion, thereby reducing the rate of advanced cases of breast cancer.},

            Breast cancer analysis implies that radiologists inspect mammograms to detect suspicious breast lesions and identify mass tumors. Artificial intelligence techniques offer automatic systems for breast mass segmentation to assist radiologists in their diagnosis. With the rapid development of deep learning and its application to medical imaging challenges, UNet and its variations is one of the state-of-the-art models for medical image segmentation that showed promising performance on mammography. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called Connected-UNets, which connects two UNets using additional modified skip connections. We integrate Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) in the two standard UNets to emphasize the contextual information within the encoder–decoder network architecture. We also apply the proposed architecture on the Attention UNet (AUNet) and the Residual UNet (ResUNet). We evaluated the proposed architectures on two publically available datasets, the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) and INbreast, and additionally on a private dataset. Experiments were also conducted using additional synthetic data using the cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) model between two unpaired datasets to augment and enhance the images. Qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed architecture can achieve better automatic mass segmentation with a high Dice score of 89.52\%, 95.28\%, and 95.88\% and Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 80.02\%, 91.03\%, and 92.27\%, respectively, on CBIS-DDSM, INbreast, and the private dataset.},

	abstract = {Due to a large amount of noise in medical images, the task of detecting and classifying the lesions of mammograms remains a huge challenge. Based on the existing deep learning methods, focusing on the diversity of breast cancer lesion types, this paper proposes a computer-aided diagnosis system based on YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) convolutional neural network for mammograms. In this system, we integrate detection and multi-classification problems of breast lesions into a regression problem, thereby simultaneously accomplish the two tasks in one framework. The proposed computer-aided diagnosis system is mainly divided into three components: preprocessing part of the original mammograms, deep convolutional neural network based on YOLOv3, processing and evaluation of the network output. We use the dataset from CBIS-DDSM to train three models: general model, mass model and microcalcification model. These trained models can detect the position of the input mammograms in different situations, and then classify them into mass, microcalcification, benign, malignant, and other categories. After evaluating the performance by using test set images, the accuracy rates of the general model, mass model, and microcalcification model trained by our system reach 93.667 \%, 97.767 \%, 96.870 \% in the detection task, and 93.927 \%, 98.121 \%, 97.045 \% in the classification task. The computer-aided diagnosis system performs well in lesion detection and classification tasks with high-noise mammograms, reflecting well robustness.},

Particularly, numerous applications provided efficient solutions to assist radiologists for medical imaging analysis.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end system, which is based on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) model, to simultaneously localize and classify suspicious breast lesions from entire mammograms. The proposed system first preprocesses the raw images, then recognizes abnormal regions as breast lesions and determines their pathology classification as either mass or calcification. We evaluated the model on two publicly available datasets, with 2907 mammograms from the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) and 235 mammograms from INbreast database. We also used a privately collected dataset with 487 mammograms. Furthermore, we suggested a fusion models approach to report more precise detection and accurate classification. Our best results reached a detection accuracy rate of 95.7\%, 98.1\% and 98\% for mass lesions and 74.4\%, 71.8\% and 73.2\% for calcification lesions, respectively on CBIS-DDSM, INbreast and the private dataset.},

However, in our work, we find that UNet has the worse segmentation performance of small masses. The reason behind this is that the sizes of receptive fields are limited. In this work, to address this issue, we develop a novel end-to-end model, Adaptive Receptive Field Network (ARF-Net), for the precise breast mass segmentation in whole mammographic images and ultrasound images. ARF-Net composes of an encoder network and a corresponding decoder network, followed by a pixel-wise classifier. In ARF-Net, a Selective Receptive Filed Module (SRFM) is proposed to allocate the suitable sizes of receptive fields to the breast masses of different sizes. SRFM consists of a Multiple Receptive Field Module (MRFM) for generating multiple receptive fields of different sizes and a Multi-Scale Selection Module (MSSM) for selecting the suitable sizes of receptive fields based on the objects’ size. The proposed ARF-Net achieves the dice index of 86.1\%, 85.75\%, and 88.12\% on the two mammographic databases (INbreast and CBIS-DDSM) and one ultrasonic database (UDIAT), respectively. Moreover, extensive ablation experiments show that ARF-Net transcends several state-of-the-art segmentation networks, and the developed MSSM exceeds several counterparts.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: Both mass detection and segmentation in digital mammograms play a crucial role in early breast cancer detection and treatment. Furthermore, clinical experience has shown that they are the upstream tasks of pathological classiﬁcation of breast lesions. Recent advancements in deep learning have made the analyses faster and more accurate. This study aims to develop a deep learning model architecture for breast cancer mass detection and segmentation using the mammography.
Methods: In this work we proposed a double shot model for mass detection and segmentation simultaneously using a combination of YOLO (You Only Look Once) and LOGO (Local-Global) architectures. Firstly, we adopted YoloV5L6, the state-of-the-art object detection model, to position and crop the breast mass in mammograms with a high resolution; Secondly, to balance training eﬃciency and segmentation performance, we modiﬁed the LOGO training strategy to train the whole images and cropped images on the global and local transformer branches separately. The two branches were then merged to form the ﬁnal segmentation decision.
Results: The proposed YOLO-LOGO model was tested on two independent mammography datasets (CBISDDSM and INBreast). The proposed model performs signiﬁcantly better than previous works. It achieves true positive rate 95.7\% and mean average precision 65.0\% for mass detection on CBIS-DDSM dataset. Its performance for mass segmentation on CBIS-DDSM dataset is F1-score=74.5\% and IoU=64.0\%. The similar performance trend is observed in another independent dataset INBreast as well.
Conclusions: The proposed model has a higher eﬃciency and better performance, reduces computational requirements, and improves the versatility and accuracy of computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis. Hence it has the potential to enable more assistance for doctors in early breast cancer detection and treatment, thereby reducing mortality.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Computer-aided-detection (CAD) systems have been developed to assist radiologists on ﬁnding suspicious lesions in mammogram. Deep Learning technology have recently succeeded to increase the chance of recognizing abnormality at an early stage in order to avoid unnecessary biopsies and decrease the mortality rate. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of an end-to-end fusion model based on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) architecture, to simultaneously detect and classify suspicious breast lesions on digital mammograms. Four categories of cases were included: Mass, Calciﬁcation, Architectural Distortions, and Normal from a private digital mammographic database including 413 cases. For all cases, Prior mammograms (typically scanned 1 year before) were all reported as Normal, while Current mammograms were diagnosed as cancerous (conﬁrmed by biopsies) or healthy.
Methods: We propose to apply the YOLO-based fusion model to the Current mammograms for breast lesions detection and classiﬁcation. Then apply the same model retrospectively to synthetic mammograms for an early cancer prediction, where the synthetic mammograms were generated from the Prior mammograms by using the image-to-image translation models, CycleGAN and Pix2Pix.
Results: Evaluation results showed that our methodology could signiﬁcantly detect and classify breast lesions on Current mammograms with a highest rate of 93\% ± 0.118 for Mass lesions, 88\% ± 0.09 for Calciﬁcation lesions, and 95\% ± 0.06 for Architectural Distortion lesions. In addition, we reported evaluation results on Prior mammograms with a highest rate of 36\% ± 0.01 for Mass lesions, 14\% ± 0.01 for Calciﬁcation lesions, and 50\% ± 0.02 for Architectural Distortion lesions. Normal mammograms were accordingly classiﬁed with an accuracy rate of 92\% ± 0.09 and 90\% ± 0.06 respectively on Current and Prior exams.
Conclusions: Our proposed framework was ﬁrst developed to help detecting and identifying suspicious breast lesions in X-ray mammograms on their Current screening. The work was also suggested to reduce the temporal changes between pairs of Prior and follow-up screenings for early predicting the location and type of abnormalities in Prior mammogram screening. The paper presented a CAD method to assist doctors and experts to identify the risk of breast cancer presence. Overall, the proposed CAD method incorporates the advances of image processing, deep learning and image-to-image translation for a biomedical application.},

            A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system requires automated stages of tumor detection, segmentation, and classification that are integrated sequentially into one framework to assist the radiologists with a final diagnosis decision. In this paper, we introduce the final step of breast mass classification and diagnosis using a stacked ensemble of residual neural network (ResNet) models (i.e. ResNet50V2, ResNet101V2, and ResNet152V2). The work presents the task of classifying the detected and segmented breast masses into malignant or benign, and diagnosing the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment category with a score from 2 to 6 and the shape as oval, round, lobulated, or irregular. The proposed methodology was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) and INbreast, and additionally on a private dataset. Comparative experiments were conducted on the individual models and an average ensemble of models with an XGBoost classifier. Qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed model achieved better performance for (1) Pathology classification with an accuracy of 95.13\%, 99.20\%, and 95.88\%; (2) BI-RADS category classification with an accuracy of 85.38\%, 99\%, and 96.08\% respectively on CBIS-DDSM, INbreast, and the private dataset; and (3) shape classification with 90.02\% on the CBIS-DDSM dataset. Our results demonstrate that our proposed integrated framework could benefit from all automated stages to outperform the latest deep learning methodologies.},

	abstract = {Our objective is to show the feasibility of using simulated mammograms to detect mammographicallyoccult (MO) cancer in women with dense breasts and a normal screening mammogram who could be triaged for additional screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound. We developed a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to simulate a mammogram with normal appearance using the opposite mammogram as the condition. We used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform (RCDT) processed mammograms to detect MO cancer. For training CGAN, we used screening mammograms of 1366 women. For MO cancer detection, we used screening mammograms of 333 women (97 MO cancer) with dense breasts. We simulated the right mammogram for normal controls and the cancer side for MO cancer cases. We created two RCDT images, one from a real mammogram pair and another from a real-simulated mammogram pair. We ﬁnetuned a VGG16 on resulting RCDT images to classify the women with MO cancer. We compared the classiﬁcation performance of the CNN trained on fused RCDT images, CNNFused to that of trained only on real RCDT images, CNNReal, and to that of trained only on simulated RCDT images, CNNSimulated. The test AUC for CNNFused was 0.77 with a 95\% conﬁdence interval (95CI) of [0.71, 0.83], which was statistically better (p-value {\textless} 0.02) than the CNNReal AUC of 0.70 with a 95CI of [0.64, 0.77] and CNNSimulated AUC of 0.68 with a 95CI of [0.62, 0.75]. It showed that CGAN simulated mammograms can help MO cancer detection.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05798},
	abstract = {Traditionally, deep learning-based methods for breast cancer classiﬁcation perform a single-view analysis. However, radiologists simultaneously analyze all four views that compose a mammography exam, owing to the correlations contained in mammography views, which present crucial information for identifying tumors. In light of this, some studies have started to propose multi-view methods. Nevertheless, in such existing architectures, mammogram views are processed as independent images by separate convolutional branches, thus losing correlations among them. To overcome such limitations, in this paper we propose a novel approach for multi-view breast cancer classiﬁcation based on parameterized hypercomplex neural networks. Thanks to hypercomplex algebra properties, our networks are able to model, and thus leverage, existing correlations between the different views that comprise a mammogram exam, thus mimicking the reading process performed by clinicians. As a consequence, the proposed method is able to handle the information of a patient altogether without breaking the multi-view nature of the exam. Starting from the proposed hypercomplex approach, we deﬁne architectures designed to process two-view exams, namely PHResNets, and four-view exams, i.e., PHYSEnet and PHYSBOnet, with the ability to grasp inter-view correlations in a wide range of clinical use cases. Through an extensive experimental evaluation conducted with two publicly available datasets, CBIS-DDSM and INbreast, we demonstrate that our parameterized hypercomplex models clearly outperform realvalued counterparts and also state-of-the-art methods, proving that breast cancer classiﬁcation beneﬁts from the proposed multi-view architecture. Full code and pretrained models for complete reproducibility of our experiments are freely available at https://github.com/ispamm/PHBreast.},

	abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in various medical imaging tasks. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations, CNNs generally cannot model long-range dependencies well, which are important for accurately identifying or mapping corresponding breast lesion features computed from unregistered multiple mammograms. This motivated us to leverage the architecture of Multi-view Vision Transformers to capture longrange relationships of multiple mammograms from the same patient in one examination. For this purpose, we employed local transformer blocks to separately learn patch relationships within four mammograms acquired from two-view (CC/MLO) of two-side (right/left) breasts. The outputs from different views and sides were concatenated and fed into global transformer blocks, to jointly learn patch relationships between four images representing two different views of the left and right breasts. To evaluate the proposed model, we retrospectively assembled a dataset involving 949 sets of mammograms, which included 470 malignant cases and 479 normal or benign cases. We trained and evaluated the model using a ﬁve-fold cross-validation method. Without any arduous preprocessing steps (e.g., optimal window cropping, chest wall or pectoral muscle removal, two-view image registration, etc.), our four-image (two-view-two-side) transformer-based model achieves case classiﬁcation performance with an area under ROC curve (AUC = 0.818 ± 0.039), which signiﬁcantly outperforms AUC = 0.784 ± 0.016 achieved by the state-of-the-art multi-view CNNs (p = 0.009). It also outperforms two one-view-two-side models that achieve AUC of 0.724 ± 0.013 (CC view) and 0.769 ± 0.036 (MLO view), respectively. The study demonstrates the potential of using transformers to develop high-performing computer-aided diagnosis schemes that combine four mammograms.},

	abstract = {Background: Nowadays, breast cancer is the second cause of death after cardiovascular diseases. In general, about one out of eight women (about 12\%) suffer from this disease during their life in the USA and European countries. If breast cancer is detected at an early stage, its survival rate will be very high. Several methods have been introduced to diagnose breast cancer with their clinical advantages and disadvantages. Main text: In this review, various methods of breast imaging have been introduced. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of each of these methods have been investigated. For each of the imaging methods, articles that were relevant to the past 10 years were selected through electronic search engines, and then the most relevant papers were selected. Finally, about 40 articles were studied and their results were categorized and presented in the form of a report as follows. Various breast cancer imaging techniques were extracted as follows: mammography, contrast-enhanced mammography, digital tomosynthesis, sonography, sonoelastography, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic elastography, diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetic spectroscopy, nuclear medicine, optical imaging, and microwave imaging. Conclusion: The choice of these methods depends on the patient’s state and stage, the age of the individual and the density of the breast tissue. Hybrid imaging techniques appear to be an acceptable way to improve detection of breast cancer. This review article can be useful in choosing the right method for imaging in people suspected of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a cancer that can form in the cells of breasts. It is much more common in females than in males. The typical periods of cancer development are during puberty, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. Thermography can be utilized for breast analysis, and provides useful data on the location of hyperthermia and the vascular state of the tissue. Computer-aided diagnosis is an algorithmic approach which can be assistive during routine screening, so that human error in breast analysis for cancer detection is reduced. In early-stage cancer, the accuracy of the assessment then increases, enabling clinicians to make an improved diagnosis of benign versus malignant classification. Herein, we have reviewed thermogram-based computer-aided diagnostic systems developed during the last two decades for breast cancer screening and analysis. We explore the quantitative and qualitative performances of machine learning based approaches, which include segmentation based and feature extraction based methods, dimensionality reduction, and various classification schemes, as proposed in the literature. We also describe the limitations, as well as future requirements to improve current techniques, which can help researchers and clinicians to be apprised of quantitative developments and to plan for the future.},

Works on this subject presented results that justify the thermography as a complementary exam to detect breast diseases. Several papers on the use of infrared imaging for breast screening can be found in the current medical literature. This survey explores and analyses these works in the light of their applications in computer vision. Consequently, the comments are organized according to the main steps of pattern recognition systems. These include: image acquisition protocols, exams storage, segmentation methods, feature extraction, classiﬁcation or diagnostic and computer modelling.

	abstract = {Developing a breast cancer screening method is very important to facilitate early breast cancer detection and treatment. Building a screening method using medical imaging modality that does not cause body tissue damage (non-invasive) and does not involve physical touch is challenging. Thermography, a non-invasive and non-contact cancer screening method, can detect tumors at an early stage even under precancerous conditions by observing temperature distribution in both breasts. The thermograms obtained on thermography can be interpreted using deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs can automatically classify breast thermograms into categories such as normal and abnormal. Despite their demostrated utility, CNNs have not been widely used in breast thermogram classiﬁcation. In this study, we aimed to summarize the current work and progress in breast cancer detection based on thermography and CNNs. We ﬁrst discuss of breast thermography potential in early breast cancer detection, providing an overview of the availability of breast thermal datasets together with publicly accessible. We also discuss characteristics of breast thermograms and the differences between healthy and cancerous thermographic patterns. Breast thermogram classiﬁcation using a CNN model is described step by step including a simulation example illustrating feature learning. We cover most research related to the implementation of deep neural networks for breast thermogram classiﬁcation and propose future research directions for developing representative datasets, feeding the segmented image, assigning a good kernel, and building a lightweight CNN model to improve CNN performance.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system for masses in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) volume using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with transfer learning from mammograms.
Methods: A data set containing 2282 digitized film and digital mammograms and 324 DBT volumes were collected with IRB approval. The mass of interest on the images was marked by an experienced breast radiologist as reference standard. The data set was partitioned into a training set (2282 mammograms with 2461 masses and 230 DBT views with 228 masses) and an independent test set (94 DBT views with 89 masses). For DCNN training, the region of interest (ROI) containing the mass (true positive) was extracted from each image. False positive (FP) ROIs were identified at prescreening by their previously developed CAD systems. After data augmentation, a total of 45 072 mammographic ROIs and 37 450 DBT ROIs were obtained. Data normalization and reduction of non-uniformity in the ROIs across heterogeneous data was achieved using a background correction method applied to each ROI. A DCNN with four convolutional layers and three fully connected (FC) layers was first trained on the mammography data. Jittering and dropout techniques were used to reduce overfitting. After training with the mammographic ROIs, all weights in the first three convolutional layers were frozen, and only the last convolution layer and the FC layers were randomly initialized again and trained using the DBT training ROIs. The authors compared the performances of two CAD systems for mass detection in DBT: one used the DCNN-based approach and the other used their previously developed feature-based approach for FP reduction. The prescreening stage was identical in both systems, passing the same set of mass candidates to the FP reduction stage. For the feature-based CAD system, 3D clustering and active contour method was used for segmentation; morphological, gray level, and texture features were extracted and merged with a linear discriminant classifier to score the detected masses. For the DCNN-based CAD system, ROIs from five consecutive slices centered at each candidate were passed through the trained DCNN and a mass likelihood score was generated. The performances of the CAD systems were evaluated using free-response ROC curves and the performance difference was analyzed using a non-parametric method.
Results: Before transfer learning, the DCNN trained only on mammograms with an AUC of 0.99 classified DBT masses with an AUC of 0.81 in the DBT training set. After transfer learning with DBT, the AUC improved to 0.90. For breast-based CAD detection in the test set, the sensitivity for the feature-based and the DCNN-based CAD systems was 83\% and 91\%, respectively, at 1 FP/DBT volume. The difference between the performances for the two systems was statistically significant (p-value {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusions: The image patterns learned from the mammograms were transferred to the mass detection on DBT slices through the DCNN. This study demonstrated that large data sets collected from mammography are useful for developing new CAD systems for DBT, alleviating the problem and effort of collecting entirely new large data sets for the new modality.

Mammography is one of the few screening modalities available to the modern world that has proved itself of much use by aiding early detection and treatment of nonpalpable, node-negative breast cancers. However, due to its two-dimensional nature, many cases of malignancies are still missed, to be detected at a later date or by an alternate modality. In 2011, FDA approved the supplemental use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in screening and diagnostic set ups. The acquisition of multiple low-dose projection images of the compressed parenchyma provided a ‘third’ dimension to the mammogram whereby the breast tissue could be seen layer by layer on the workstation. It improves cancer detection rate, and reduces recall rate and false-positive findings by improving lesion characterization. The current review discusses the principle of DBT with a comprehensive study of the literature.},

	abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are a set of techniques that exploit large and/or complex real-world datasets for cross-domain and cross-discipline prediction and classification tasks. DL architectures excel in computer vision tasks, and in particular image processing and interpretation. This has prompted a wave of disruptingly innovative applications in medical imaging, where DL strategies have the potential to vastly outperform human experts. This is particularly relevant in the context of histopathology, where whole slide imaging (WSI) of stained tissue in conjuction with DL algorithms for their interpretation, selection and cancer staging are beginning to play an ever increasing role in supporting human operators in visual assessments. This has the potential to reduce everyday workload as well as to increase precision and reproducibility across observers, centers, staining techniques and even pathologies. In this paper we introduce the most common DL architectures used in image analysis, with a focus on histopathological image analysis in general and in breast histology in particular. We briefly review how, state-of-art DL architectures compare to human performance on across a number of critical tasks such as mitotic count, tubules analysis and nuclear pleomorphism analysis. Also, the development of DL algorithms specialized to pathology images have been enormously fueled by a number of world-wide challenges based on large, mul­ ticentric image databases which are now publicly available. In turn, this has allowed most recent efforts to shift more and more towards semi-supervised learning methods, which provide greater flexibility and applicability. We also review all major repositories of manually labelled pathology images in breast cancer and provide an indepth discussion of the challenges specific to training DL architectures to interpret WSI data, as well as a review of the state-of-the-art methods for interpretation of images generated from immunohistochemical analysis of breast lesions. We finally discuss the future challenges and opportunities which the adoption of DL paradigms is most likely to pose in the field of pathology for breast cancer detection, diagnosis, staging and prognosis. This review is intended as a comprehensive stepping stone into the field of modern computational pathology for a transdisciplinary readership across technical and medical disciplines.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Breast cancer, one of the most common health threats to females worldwide, has always been a crucial topic in the medical field. With the rapid development of digital pathology, many scholars have used AI-based systems to classify breast cancer pathological images. However, most existing studies only stayed on the binary classification of breast lesions (normal vs tumor or benign vs malignant), far from meeting the clinical demand. Therefore, we established a multi-class classification system of breast digital pathology images based on AI, which is more clinically practical than the binary classification system.
Methods: In this paper, we adopted a two-stage architecture based on deep learning method and machine learning method for the multi-class classification (normal tissue, benign lesion, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinoma) of breast digital pathological images.
Results: The proposed approach achieved an overall accuracy of 86.67\% at patch-level. At WSI-level, the overall accuracies of our classification system were 88.16\% on validation data and 90.43\% on test data. Additionally, we used two public datasets, the BreakHis and BACH, for independent verification. The accuracies our model obtained on these two datasets were comparable to related publications. Furthermore, our model could achieve accuracies of 85.19\% on multi-classification and 96.30\% on binary classification (nonmalignant vs malignant) using pathology images of frozen sections, which was proven to have good generalizability. Then, we used t-SNE for visualization of patch classification efficiency. Finally, we analyzed morphological characteristics of patches learned by the model.
Conclusion: The proposed two-stage model could be effectively applied to the multi-class classification task of breast pathology images and could be a very useful tool for assisting pathologists in diagnosing breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is a major health problem, being the most common cancer in women. Early detection of breast cancer aims to the reduction of mortality and morbidity rates. Conventional screening methods include mammography and ultrasonography; however, both modalities have their limitations. Automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is a recent technological advancement in the field of breast imaging having the benefit of standardization of the scans and lack of operator dependence as in conventional handheld ultrasound scans. The aim of this work was to report our initial experience of the added value of ABUS as a breast screening tool. The study included 200 patients who had screening mammograms, ultrasound, and ABUS.
Results: A significant difference was found between the number of lesions detected by ABUS and conventional ultrasound. A significant difference was found between lesions detected by ABUS and mammography which was most evident in patients with dense breasts.
Conclusions: ABUS is a valuable tool in the screening of the breast with improved lesion detection, especially in patients with dense breasts.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer in women is the second most common cancer worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer can reduce the risk of human life. Non-invasive techniques such as mammograms and ultrasound imaging are popularly used to detect the tumour. However, histopathological analysis is necessary to determine the malignancy of the tumour as it analyses the image at the cellular level. Manual analysis of these slides is time consuming, tedious, subjective and are susceptible to human errors. Also, at times the interpretation of these images are inconsistent between laboratories. Hence, a Computer-Aided Diagnostic system that can act as a decision support system is need of the hour. Moreover, recent developments in computational power and memory capacity led to the application of computer tools and medical image processing techniques to process and analyze breast cancer histopathological images. This review paper summarizes various traditional and deep learning based methods developed to analyze breast cancer histopathological images. Initially, the characteristics of breast cancer histopathological images are discussed. A detailed discussion on the various potential regions of interest is presented which is crucial for the development of Computer-Aided Diagnostic systems. We summarize the recent trends and choices made during the selection of medical image processing techniques. Finally, a detailed discussion on the various challenges involved in the analysis of BCHI is presented along with the future scope.},

            Though consistently shown to detect mammographically occult cancers, breast ultrasound has been noted to have high false-positive rates. In this work, we present an AI system that achieves radiologist-level accuracy in identifying breast cancer in ultrasound images. Developed on 288,767 exams, consisting of 5,442,907 B-mode and Color Doppler images, the AI achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.976 on a test set consisting of 44,755 exams. In a retrospective reader study, the AI achieves a higher AUROC than the average of ten board-certified breast radiologists (AUROC: 0.962 AI, 0.924 ± 0.02 radiologists). With the help of the AI, radiologists decrease their false positive rates by 37.3\% and reduce requested biopsies by 27.8\%, while maintaining the same level of sensitivity. This highlights the potential of AI in improving the accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of breast ultrasound diagnosis.},

The rapid advancement of computational power and deep learning has increased greatly in AI research, with promising performance in detection and classification tasks across imaging modalities. Most AI systems, based on human-engineered or deep learning methods, serve as concurrent or secondary readers, that is, as aids to radiologists for a specific, well-defined task. In the future, AI may be able to perform multiple integrated tasks, making decisions at the level of or surpassing the ability of humans. Artificial intelligence may also serve as a partial primary reader to streamline ancillary tasks, triaging cases or ruling out obvious normal cases. However, before AI is used as an independent, autonomous reader, various challenges need to be addressed, including explainability and interpretability, in addition to repeatability and generalizability, to ensure that AI will provide a significant clinical benefit to breast cancer screening across all populations.},

	abstract = {It is important to detect breast cancer as early as possible. In this manuscript, a new methodology for classifying breast cancer using deep learning and some segmentation techniques are introduced. A new computer aided detection (CAD) system is proposed for classifying benign and malignant mass tumors in breast mammography images. In this CAD system, two segmentation approaches are used. The first approach involves determining the region of interest (ROI) manually, while the second approach uses the technique of threshold and region based. The deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is used for feature extraction. A well-known DCNN architecture named AlexNet is used and is fine-tuned to classify two classes instead of 1,000 classes. The last fully connected (fc) layer is connected to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to obtain better accuracy. The results are obtained using the following publicly available datasets (1) the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM); and (2) the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM). Training on a large number of data gives high accuracy rate. Nevertheless, the biomedical datasets contain a relatively small number of samples due to limited patient volume. Accordingly, data augmentation is a method for increasing the size of the input data by generating new data from the original input data. There are many forms for the data augmentation; the one used here is the rotation. The accuracy of the new-trained DCNN architecture is 71.01\% when cropping the ROI manually from the mammogram. The highest area under the curve (AUC) achieved was 0.88 (88\%) for the samples obtained from both segmentation techniques. Moreover, when using the samples obtained from the CBISDDSM, the accuracy of the DCNN is increased to 73.6\%. Consequently, the SVM accuracy becomes 87.2\% with an AUC equaling to 0.94 (94\%). This is the highest AUC value compared to previous work using the same conditions.},

	abstract = {Cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases to humans, and yet no permanent cure has been developed for it. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer types. According to the National Breast Cancer foundation, in 2020 alone, more than 276,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer and more than 48,000 non-invasive cases were diagnosed in the US. To put these figures in perspective, 64\% of these cases are diagnosed early in the disease’s cycle, giving patients a 99\% chance of survival. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been used effectively in detection and treatment of several dangerous diseases, helping in early diagnosis and treatment, and thus increasing the patient’s chance of survival. Deep learning has been designed to analyze the most important features affecting detection and treatment of serious diseases. For example, breast cancer can be detected using genes or histopathological imaging. Analysis at the genetic level is very expensive, so histopathological imaging is the most common approach used to detect breast cancer. In this research work, we systematically reviewed previous work done on detection and treatment of breast cancer using genetic sequencing or histopathological imaging with the help of deep learning and machine learning. We also provide recommendations to researchers who will work in this field.},

	abstract = {Breast Cancer (BC) is one of the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Approximately 10 million people pass away internationally from breast cancer in the year 2020. Breast Cancer is a fatal disease and very popular among women globally. It is ranked fourth among the fatal diseases of different cancers, for example colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, and brain tumors. Furthermore, the number of new cases of breast cancer is anticipated to upsurge by 70\% in the next twenty years. Consequently, early detection and precise diagnosis of breast cancer plays an essential part in enhancing the diagnosis and improving the breast cancer survival rate of patients from 30 to 50\%. Through the advances of technology in healthcare, deep learning takes a significant role in handling and inspecting a great number of X-ray, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) images. The aim of this study is to propose a deep learning model to detect and classify breast cancers. Breast cancers has eight classes of cancers: benign adenosis, benign fibroadenoma, benign phyllodes tumor, benign tubular adenoma, malignant ductal carcinoma, malignant lobular carcinoma, malignant mucinous carcinoma, and malignant papillary carcinoma. The dataset was collected from Kaggle depository for breast cancer detection and classification. The measurement that was used in the evaluation of the proposed model includes: F1-score, recall, precision, accuracy. The proposed model was trained, validated and tested using the preprocessed dataset. The results showed that Precision was (97.60\%), Recall (97.60\%) and F1-Score (97.58\%). This indicates that deep learning models are suitable for detecting and classifying breast cancers precisely.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the leading fatal disease worldwide with high risk control if early discovered. Conventional method for breast screening is x-ray mammography, which is known to be challenging for early detection of cancer lesions. The dense breast structure produced due to the compression process during imaging lead to difficulties to recognize small size abnormalities. Also, inter- and intra-variations of breast tissues lead to significant difficulties to achieve high diagnosis accuracy using hand-crafted features. Deep learning is an emerging machine learning technology that requires a relatively high computation power. Yet, it proved to be very effective in several difficult tasks that requires decision making at the level of human intelligence. In this paper, we develop a new network architecture inspired by the U-net structure that can be used for effective and early detection of breast cancer. Results indicate a high rate of sensitivity and specificity that indicate potential usefulness of the proposed approach in clinical use.},

With the advent of Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), recently, deep learning techniques have been used effectively in breast cancer detection, facilitating early diagnosis and therefore increasing the chances of patients’ survival. Compared to classical machine learning techniques, deep learning requires less human intervention for similar feature extraction. This study presents a systematic literature review on the deep learning-based methods for breast cancer detection that can guide practitioners and researchers in understanding the challenges and new trends in the ﬁeld. Particularly, different deep learning-based methods for breast cancer detection are investigated, focusing on the genomics and histopathological imaging data. The study speciﬁcally adopts the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), which offer a detailed analysis and synthesis of the published articles. Several studies were searched and gathered, and after the eligibility screening and quality evaluation, 98 articles were identiﬁed. The results of the review indicated that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the most accurate and extensively used model for breast cancer detection, and the accuracy metrics are the most popular method used for performance evaluation. Moreover, datasets utilized for breast cancer detection and the evaluation metrics are also studied. Finally, the challenges and future research direction in breast cancer detection based on deep learning models are also investigated to help researchers and practitioners acquire in-depth knowledge of and insight into the area.},

First of all, the INbreast dataset is preprocessed to remove external artifacts. Second, in the contracting path, enhance features of the Region of Interest(ROI) of the mammogram through the Coordinate Attention Module. Finally, in the expansive path, the local feature enhancement can be achieved by Attention Gates is used instead to combine the shallow layer and upsampling feature maps directly. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a good segmentation effect for the mammogram, and its the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the Intersection of Union(IoU) are 91.8\% and 85.8\%, respectively. Furthermore, we obtained DSC and IoU of 98.4\%, 96.8\%, respectively, for women with high breast density. Compared with the conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) algorithm, the DSC increased by 3.36\%, IoU increased by 5.91\%. The better segmentation achieved can help doctors accurately judge breast density categories.},

Early diagnosis helps to start treatment early, which is more effective and less expensive. The lives of cancer patients can be improved significantly by early detection and avoiding treatment delays. This paper presents the design and development of a secure cloud-based breast cancer diagnosis system. The proposed system uses using convolutional neural network for breast mass classification. Fragile zero watermarking will be implemented to secure the transmission of mammographs. The proposed system will enable women living in remote areas to get the facility for the routine initial screening near their homes without making their identity and medical data vulnerable. It will reduce the cost and time by avoiding frequent visits of the patients to specialized health care centers. On the other hand, it will help enhance the quality of service at specialized healthcare centers by reducing the number of patients in the initial screening.},

            Published research results are difficult to replicate due to the lack of a standard evaluation data set in the area of decision support systems in mammography; most computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) algorithms for breast cancer in mammography are evaluated on private data sets or on unspecified subsets of public databases. This causes an inability to directly compare the performance of methods or to replicate prior results. We seek to resolve this substantial challenge by releasing an updated and standardized version of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) for evaluation of future CADx and CADe systems (sometimes referred to generally as CAD) research in mammography. Our data set, the CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM), includes decompressed images, data selection and curation by trained mammographers, updated mass segmentation and bounding boxes, and pathologic diagnosis for training data, formatted similarly to modern computer vision data sets. The data set contains 753 calcification cases and 891 mass cases, providing a data-set size capable of analyzing decision support systems in mammography.},

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is one of the branches of artificial intelligence that has seen exponential growth in recent years. The scientific community has focused its attention on DL due to its versatility, high performance, high generalization capacity, and multidisciplinary uses, among many other qualities. In addition, a large amount of medical data and the development of more powerful computers has also fostered an interest in this area. This paper presents an overview of current deep learning methods, starting from the most straightforward concept but accompanied by the mathematical models that are behind the functionality of this type of intelligence. In the first instance, the fundamental concept of artificial neural networks is introduced, progressively covering convolu­ tional structures, recurrent networks, attention models, up to the current structure known as the Transformer. Secondly, all the basic concepts involved in training and other common elements in the design of the archi­ tectures are introduced. Thirdly, some of the key elements in modern networks for medical image classification and segmentation are shown. Subsequently, a review of some applications realized in the last years is shown, where the main features related to DL are highlighted. Finally, the perspectives and future expectations of deep learning are presented.},

This article provides basic definitions of terms such as “machine/deep learning” and analyses the integration of AI into radiology. Publications on AI have drastically increased from about 100–150 per year in 2007–2008 to 700–800 per year in 2016–2017. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography collectively account for more than 50\% of current articles. Neuroradiology appears in about one-third of the papers, followed by musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, breast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdomen, each representing 6–9\% of articles. With an irreversible increase in the amount of data and the possibility to use AI to identify findings either detectable or not by the human eye, radiology is now moving from a subjective perceptual skill to a more objective science. Radiologists, who were on the forefront of the digital era in medicine, can guide the introduction of AI into healthcare. Yet, they will not be replaced because radiology includes communication of diagnosis, consideration of patient’s values and preferences, medical judgment, quality assurance, education, policy-making, and interventional procedures. The higher efficiency provided by AI will allow radiologists to perform more value-added tasks, becoming more visible to patients and playing a vital role in multidisciplinary clinical teams.},

            A decade of unprecedented progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated the potential for many fields—including medicine—to benefit from the insights that AI techniques can extract from data. Here we survey recent progress in the development of modern computer vision techniques—powered by deep learning—for medical applications, focusing on medical imaging, medical video, and clinical deployment. We start by briefly summarizing a decade of progress in convolutional neural networks, including the vision tasks they enable, in the context of healthcare. Next, we discuss several example medical imaging applications that stand to benefit—including cardiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology–and propose new avenues for continued work. We then expand into general medical video, highlighting ways in which clinical workflows can integrate computer vision to enhance care. Finally, we discuss the challenges and hurdles required for real-world clinical deployment of these technologies.},

Advances in machine learning resulted in the rise of radiomics that is a new methodology referring to the extraction of quantitative information from medical images. Radiomics are based on the development of computational models, referred to as “Radiomic Signatures”, trying to address either unmet clinical needs, mostly in the field of oncologic imaging, or to compare radiomics performance with that of radiologists. However, to explore this new technology, initial publications did not consider best practices in the field of machine learning resulting in publications with questionable clinical value.

The most common breast abnormalities that may indicate breast cancer are masses and calcifications. In some cases, subtle signs that can also lead to a breast cancer diagnosis, such as architectural distortion and bilateral asymmetry, are present. Breast abnormalities are defined with wide range of features and may be easily missed or misinterpreted by radiologists while reading large amount of mammographic images provided in screening programs. To help radiologists provide an accurate diagnosis, a computer-aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) algorithms are being developed. CADe and CADx algorithms help reducing the number of false positives and they assist radiologists in deciding between follow up and biopsy. This chapter gives a survey of image processing algorithms that have been developed for detection of masses and calcifications. An overview of algorithms in each step (segmentation step, feature extraction step, feature selection step, classification step) of the mass detection algorithms is given. Wavelet detection methods and other recently proposed methods for calcification detection are presented. An overview of contrast enhancement and noise equalization methods is given as well as an overview of calcification classification algorithms.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer continues to be a signiﬁcant public health problem in the world. Early detection is the key for improving breast cancer prognosis. Mammography has been one of the most reliable methods for early detection of breast carcinomas. However, it is difﬁcult for radiologists to provide both accurate and uniform evaluation for the enormous mammograms generated in widespread screening. The estimated sensitivity of radiologists in breast cancer screening is only about 75\%, but the performance would be improved if they were prompted with the possible locations of abnormalities. Breast cancer CAD systems can provide such help and they are important and necessary for breast cancer control. Microcalciﬁcations and masses are the two most important indicators of malignancy, and their automated detection is very valuable for early breast cancer diagnosis. Since masses are often indistinguishable from the surrounding parenchymal, automated mass detection and classiﬁcation is even more challenging. This paper discusses the methods for mass detection and classiﬁcation, and compares their advantages and drawbacks.},

High resolution mammograms usually lead to more accurate diagnoses; however, they require large doses of radiation, which may have harmful effects. In this paper, we present a method to synthesize high-resolution mammograms from low-resolution inputs, which offers the potential of allowing accurate diagnoses while minimizing risks to patients. Our algorithm combines statistical machine learning methods and stochastic search to learn the mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution mammograms using a large dataset of training image pairs. Experimental results show that the super-resolution algorithm can generate highquality, high-resolution breast mammograms from low-resolution input with no human intervention.},

	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has been widely applied for mammographic image classiﬁcation. However, most of the existing methods are based on a single mammography view and cannot sufﬁciently extract discriminative features, thereby resulting in an unsatisfactory classiﬁcation accuracy. To solve this problem and improve the mammographic image classiﬁcation performance, we propose a novel multi-view convolutional neural network (CNN) based on multiple mammography views in this paper. Considering that the images acquired from different perspectives contain different and complementary breast mass information, we modify the CNN architecture to exploit the complementary information from the various views of mammography. The new architecture can extract discriminative features from the mediolateral oblique (MLO) and craniocaudal (CC) views of the mammographic images and can effectively incorporate these features for mammographic images. The dilated convolutional layers enable the feature maps extracted from the multiple breast mass views to capture information from a large ‘‘ﬁeld of vision’’. Moreover, multiscale features are obtained by using the convolutional and dilated convolutions. In addition, we incorporate a penalty term into the cross entropy loss function, which enables the model evolution to reduce the misclassiﬁcation rate by enhancing the contributions of the samples misclassiﬁed in the training process. The proposed method was evaluated and compared with several state-of-the-art methods on the open Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits a better performance than those of the state-of-the-art methods.},

Existing methods of mammographic density classiﬁcation either require steps of manual operations or achieve only moderate classiﬁcation accuracy due to the limited model capacity. In this study, we present a radiomics approach based on dilated and attention-guided residual learning for the task of mammographic density classiﬁcation. The proposed method was instantiated with two datasets, one clinical dataset and one publicly available dataset, and classiﬁcation accuracies of 88.7 and 70.0 percent were obtained, respectively. Although the classiﬁcation accuracy of the public dataset was lower than the clinical dataset, which was very likely related to the dataset size, our proposed model still achieved a better performance than the naive residual networks and several recently published deep learningbased approaches. Furthermore, we designed a multi-stream network architecture speciﬁcally targeting at analyzing the multi-view mammograms. Utilizing the clinical dataset, we validated that multi-view inputs were beneﬁcial to the breast density classiﬁcation task with an increase of at least 2.0 percent in accuracy and the different views lead to different model classiﬁcation capacities. Our method has a great potential to be further developed and applied in computer-aided diagnosis systems. Our code is available at https://github. com/lich0031/Mammographic\_Density\_Classiﬁcation.},

              While detection of malignancies on mammography has received a boost with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), detection of cancers of very small size remains challenging. This is however clinically significant as the purpose of mammography is early detection of cancer, making it imperative to pick them up when they are still very small. Mammography has the highest spatial resolution (image sizes as high as 3328 × 4096 pixels) out of all imaging modalities, a requirement that stems from the need to detect fine features of the smallest cancers on screening. However due to computational constraints, most state of the art CNNs work on reduced resolution images. Those that work on higher resolutions, compromise on global context and work at single scale. In this work, we show that resolution, scale and image-context are all important independent factors in detection of small masses. We thereby use a fully convolutional network, with the ability to take any input size. In addition, we incorporate a systematic multi-scale, multi-resolution approach, and encode image context, which we show are critical factors to detection of small masses. We show that this approach improves the detection of cancer, particularly for small masses in comparison to the baseline model. We perform a single institution multicentre study, and show the performance of the model on a diagnostic mammography dataset, a screening mammography dataset, as well as a curated dataset of small cancers {\textless} 1 cm in size. We show that our approach improves the sensitivity from 61.53 to 87.18\% at 0.3 False Positives per Image (FPI) on this small cancer dataset. Model and code are available from

	abstract = {Mammogram malignancy classiﬁcation with only image-level annotations is challenging due to a lack of lesion annotations. If we can generate the healthy version of the diseased data, we can easily explore the lesion features. An intuitive idea of such generation is to use existing Cycle-GAN based methods. They achieve the healthy generation regarding healthy images as reference domain, while maintaining the original content by cycle consistency mechanism. However, healthy mammogram patterns are diverse which may lead to uncertain generations. Moreover, the back translation from healthy to the original remains an ill-posed problem due to lack of lesion information. To address these problems, we propose a novel model called bilateral residual generating adversarial network(BR-GAN). We use the Cycle-GAN as a basic framework while regarding the contralateral as generation reference based on the bilateral symmetry prior. To address the ill-posed back translation problem, we propose a residual-preserved mechanism to try to preserve the lesion features from the original features. The generated features and the original features are aggregated for further classiﬁcation. BR-GAN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on INBreast and in-house datasets.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a type of cancer that has risen to be the second cause of death among women. Classiﬁcation of breast tissues into normal, benign, or malignant depends on the presence of abnormalities like microcalciﬁcations, masses, architectural distortions, and asymmetries. Architectural distortion (AD) is subtle in detection with no association with masses but shows the abnormal arrangement of tissue strands, often in a radial, spiculation, or random pattern. It is widely rated as the third symptom of breast cancer which is the most commonly missed abnormality. Most computational approaches characterizing abnormalities in breast images often concentrate on the detection of microcalciﬁcation and masses with architectural distortions appearing as a secondary ﬁnding. The subtle nature and a minimal occurrence of architectural distortions may seem to complicate computational approaches for its detection. As a result, little research interest has been recorded in this area. It is widely reported that some cases of recent breast cancer are wrongly diagnosed due to the omission in detecting the presence of architectural distortion at the early stage of the disease. However, we discovered that most computational solutions to early detection of breast cancer are focused mainly on detecting other abnormalities such as masses and microcalciﬁcation, which are some evidence of the advanced stage of the disease. To emphasise the little efforts channeled towards detection of AD compared to other abnormalities, this article aims to detail the review of such studies in the last decade. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the ﬁrst review which focuses on the detection of architectural distortion (AD) from mammographic images. Furthermore, this article presents a comprehensive review of approaches, advances, and challenges on the computational methods for detecting AD, with the sole aim of advancing the use of deep learning models in detecting AD. Moreover, a comparative study of performance analyses of articles surveyed in this article is investigated. Our ﬁndings revealed that about 70\% of the existing literature adopted Gabor Filters, while just less than 10\% leveraged on the state-ofthe-art performances recorded in computer vision and deep learning, in building outstanding computational models for the detection of AD. The current study also discovered that using a deep learning approach, such as the convolution neural network (CNN) method, can yield a signiﬁcant increase in performance for the task of detection of architectural distortions. This assertion is based on literature results obtained using the CNN, which generates an accuracy of 99.4\% compared to the use of Gabor ﬁlters method, which accounts for 95\% accuracy.},

	abstract = {Judgement, as one of the core tenets of medicine, relies upon the integration of multilayered data with nuanced decision making. Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed. Although most studies evaluating AI applications in oncology to date have not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability, the results do highlight increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to ­clinical use and to impact future directions in cancer care.

However, almost all these methods suffer from a high number of false positives. In this paper we propose a new approach for tackling this false positive reduction problem. The key point of our proposal is the use of Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for representing the textural properties of the masses. We extend the basic LBP histogram descriptor into a spatially enhanced histogram which encodes both the local region appearance and the spatial structure of the masses. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are then used for classifying the true masses from the ones being actually normal parenchyma. Our approach is evaluated using 1792 ROIs extracted from the DDSM database. The experiments show that LBP are effective and efﬁcient descriptors for mammographic masses. Moreover, the comparison with current methods illustrates that our proposal obtains a better performance.},

The main innovation behind this methodology lies in the use of deep learning models for the problem of jointly classifying unregistered mammogram views and respective segmentation maps of breast lesions (i.e., masses and micro-calciﬁcations). This is a holistic methodology that can classify a whole mammographic exam, containing the CC and MLO views and the segmentation maps, as opposed to the classiﬁcation of individual lesions, which is the dominant approach in the ﬁeld. We also demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of using the segmentation maps generated by automated mass and micro-calciﬁcation detection systems, and still producing accurate results. The semi-automated approach (using manually deﬁned mass and micro-calciﬁcation segmentation maps) is tested on two publicly available datasets (INbreast and DDSM), and results show that the volume under ROC surface (VUS) for a 3-class problem (normal tissue, benign and malignant) is over 0.9, the area under ROC curve (AUC) for the 2-class ”benign vs malignant” problem is over 0.9, and for the 2class breast screening problem (malignancy vs normal/benign) is also over 0.9. For the fully automated approach, the VUS results on INbreast is over 0.7, and the AUC for the 2-class ”benign vs malignant” problem is over 0.78, and the AUC for the 2-class breast screening is 0.86.},

In this work, we explore a superivised learning approach for retrieval of mammogram images, of which the goal is to serve as a diagnostic aid for breast cancer. We propose that the most meaningful measure is one that is designed speciﬁcally to match that perceived by the radiologists in their interpretation of mammogram lesions. In our approach, we model the notion of similarity as an unknown function of the image features characterizing the lesions, and use modern machine-learning algorithms to learn this function from similarity scores collected from radiologists in reader studies. This approach is evaluated using data collected from an observer study with a set of clinical mammograms. Our results demonstrate that the proposed machine learning approach can be used to model the notion of similarity as judged by expert readers in their interpretation of mammogram images and that it can outperform alternative similarity measures derived from unsupervised learning.},

In examining a mammogram, the decision regarding a particular region of interest (RoI) is dependent on the appearance of the surrounding regions. However, in existing methods to detect AD the inference about an RoI is dependent on the appearance of this RoI alone. In addition, multiple radiologists infer the same mammogram in coming to a final decision about the mammogram. Contrary to popular ensemble classifiers like Adaboost and Random Forest, the authors propose an ensemble based method (imitating multiple radiologists by classifiers) for detecting AD such that the decision on a test RoI is dependent on the decisions of the surrounding RoIs in the proposed ensemble classifier. The proposed contextbased ensemble classifier has been validated on two mammographic databases. The proposal shows promising results in both the databases.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: The automatic classiﬁcation of breast imaging lesions is currently an unsolved problem. This paper describes an innovative representation learning framework for breast cancer diagnosis in mammography that integrates deep learning techniques to automatically learn discriminative features avoiding the design of speciﬁc hand-crafted image-based feature detectors.
Methods: A new biopsy proven benchmarking dataset was built from 344 breast cancer patients’ cases containing a total of 736 ﬁlm mammography (mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal) views, representative of manually segmented lesions associated with masses: 426 benign lesions and 310 malignant lesions. The developed method comprises two main stages: (i) preprocessing to enhance image details and (ii) supervised training for learning both the features and the breast imaging lesions classiﬁer. In contrast to previous works, we adopt a hybrid approach where convolutional neural networks are used to learn the representation in a supervised way instead of designing particular descriptors to explain the content of mammography images.
Results: Experimental results using the developed benchmarking breast cancer dataset demonstrated that our method exhibits signiﬁcant improved performance when compared to state-of-the-art image descriptors, such as histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and histogram of the gradient divergence (HGD), increasing the performance from 0.787 to 0.822 in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Interestingly, this model also outperforms a set of hand-crafted features that take advantage of additional information from segmentation by the radiologist. Finally, the combination of both representations, learned and hand-crafted, resulted in the best descriptor for mass lesion classiﬁcation, obtaining 0.826 in the AUC score.
Conclusions: A novel deep learning based framework to automatically address classiﬁcation of breast mass lesions in mammography was developed. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

              In the last two decades, Computer Aided Detection (CAD) systems were developed to help radiologists analyse screening mammograms, however benefits of current CAD technologies appear to be contradictory, therefore they should be improved to be ultimately considered useful. Since 2012, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been a tremendous success in image recognition, reaching human performance. These methods have greatly surpassed the traditional approaches, which are similar to currently used CAD solutions. Deep CNN-s have the potential to revolutionize medical image analysis. We propose a CAD system based on one of the most successful object detection frameworks, Faster R-CNN. The system detects and classifies malignant or benign lesions on a mammogram without any human intervention. The proposed method sets the state of the art classification performance on the public INbreast database, AUC = 0.95. The approach described here has achieved 2nd place in the Digital Mammography DREAM Challenge with AUC = 0.85. When used as a detector, the system reaches high sensitivity with very few false positive marks per image on the INbreast dataset.

	abstract = {Deep learning approaches to breast cancer detection in mammograms have recently shown promising results. However, such models are constrained by the limited size of publicly available mammography datasets, in large part due to privacy concerns and the high cost of generating expert annotations. Limited dataset size is further exacerbated by substantial class imbalance since “normal” images dramatically outnumber those with ﬁndings. Given the rapid progress of generative models in synthesizing realistic images, and the known eﬀectiveness of simple data augmentation techniques (e.g. horizontal ﬂipping), we ask if it is possible to synthetically augment mammogram datasets using generative adversarial networks (GANs). We train a class-conditional GAN to perform contextual in-ﬁlling, which we then use to synthesize lesions onto healthy screening mammograms. First, we show that GANs are capable of generating high-resolution synthetic mammogram patches. Next, we experimentally evaluate using the augmented dataset to improve breast cancer classiﬁcation performance. We observe that a ResNet-50 classiﬁer trained with GAN-augmented training data produces a higher AUROC compared to the same model trained only on traditionally augmented data, demonstrating the potential of our approach.},

We develop a context-sensitive deep neural network (DNN), aimed to take into account both the local image features of an MC and its surrounding tissue background, for MC detection. The DNN classiﬁer is trained to automatically extract the relevant image features of an MC as well as its image context. The proposed approach was evaluated on a set of 292 mammograms using free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis on the accuracy both in detecting individual MCs and in detecting MC clusters. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach could achieve signiﬁcantly higher FROC curves when compared to two MC-based detectors. It indicates that incorporating image context information in MC detection can be beneﬁcial for reducing the FPs in detections.},

	abstract = {Mammogram is the most eﬀective imaging modality for the mass lesion detection of breast cancer at the early stage. The information from the two paired views (i.e., medio-lateral oblique and craniocaudal) are highly relational and complementary, and this is crucial for doctors’ decisions in clinical practice. However, existing mass detection methods do not consider jointly learning eﬀective features from the two relational views. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel mammogram mass detection framework, termed Cross-View Relation Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CVR-RCNN). The proposed CVR-RCNN is expected to capture the latent relation information between the corresponding mass region of interests (ROIs) from the two paired views. Evaluations on a new large-scale private dataset and a public mammogram dataset show that the proposed CVR-RCNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art mass detection methods. Meanwhile, our experimental results suggest that incorporating the relation information across two views helps to train a superior detection model, which is a promising avenue for mammogram mass detection.},

While computer-assisted diagnosis algorithms have made great progress in generating reliable global predictions, few focus on simultaneously producing regions of interest (ROIs) for biopsy. Can we combine ROI-oriented algorithms with global classiﬁcation of cancer status, which simultaneously highlight suspicious regions and optimize classiﬁcation performance? Can the asymmetry of breasts be adopted in deep learning for ﬁnding lesions and classifying cancers? We answer the above questions by building deep-learning networks that identify masses and microcalciﬁcations in paired mammograms, exclude false positives, and stepwisely improve performance of the model with asymmetric information regarding the breasts. This method achieved a co-leading place in the Digital Mammography DREAM Challenge for predicting breast cancer. We highlight here the importance of this dual-purpose process that simultaneously provides the locations of potential lesions in mammograms.},

	abstract = {Mass detection is a critical process in the examination of mammograms. The shape and texture of the mass are key parameters used in the diagnosis of breast cancer. To recover the shape of the mass, semantic segmentation is found to be more useful rather than mere object detection (or) localization. The main challenges involved in the mass segmentation include: (a) low signal to noise ratio (b) indiscernible mass boundaries, and (c) more false positives. These problems arise due to the significant overlap in the intensities of both the normal parenchymal region and the mass region. To address these challenges, deeply supervised U-Net model (DS U-Net) coupled with dense conditional random fields (CRFs) is proposed. Here, the input images are preprocessed using CLAHE and a modified encoder-decoder-based deep learning model is used for segmentation. In general, the encoder captures the textual information of various regions in an input image, whereas the decoder recovers the spatial location of the desired region of interest. The encoderdecoder-based models lack the ability to recover the non-conspicuous and spiculated mass boundaries. In the proposed work, deep supervision is integrated with a popular encoder-decoder model (U-Net) to improve the attention of the network toward the boundary of the suspicious regions. The final segmentation map is also created as a linear combination of the intermediate feature maps and the output feature map. The dense CRF is then used to finetune the segmentation map for the recovery of definite edges. The DS U-Net with dense CRF is evaluated on two publicly available benchmark datasets CBIS-DDSM and INBREAST. It provides a dice score of 82.9\% for CBIS-DDSM and 79\% for INBREAST.},

In this regard, U-Net has been the most popular architecture in the medical imaging community.

Therefore, we propose some modifications to improve upon the already state-of-the-art U-Net model. Following these modifications, we develop a novel architecture, MultiResUNet, as the potential successor to the U-Net architecture. We have tested and compared MultiResUNet with the classical U-Net on a vast repertoire of multimodal medical images. Although only slight improvements in the cases of ideal images are noticed, remarkable gains in performance have been attained for the challenging ones. We have evaluated our model on five different datasets, each with their own unique challenges, and have obtained a relative improvement in performance of 10.15\%, 5.07\%, 2.63\%, 1.41\%, and 0.62\% respectively.

	abstract = {Mammogram mass detection is crucial for diagnosing and preventing the breast cancers in clinical practice. The complementary effect of multi-view mammogram images provides valuable information about the breast anatomical prior structure and is of great signiﬁcance in digital mammography interpretation. However, unlike radiologists who can utilize the natural reasoning ability to identify masses based on multiple mammographic views, how to endow the existing object detection models with the capability of multi-view reasoning is vital for decision-making in clinical diagnosis but remains the boundary to explore. In this paper, we propose an Anatomy-aware Graph convolutional Network (AGN), which is tailored for mammogram mass detection and endows existing detection methods with multi-view reasoning ability. The proposed AGN consists of three steps. Firstly, we introduce a Bipartite Graph convolutional Network (BGN) to model the intrinsic geometric and semantic relations of ipsilateral views. Secondly, considering that the visual asymmetry of bilateral views is widely adopted in clinical practice to assist the diagnosis of breast lesions, we propose an Inception Graph convolutional Network (IGN) to model the structural similarities of bilateral views. Finally, based on the constructed graphs, the multi-view information is propagated through nodes methodically, which equips the features learned from the examined view with multi-view reasoning ability. Experiments on two standard benchmarks reveal that AGN signiﬁcantly exceeds the state-of-the-art performance. Visualization results show that AGN provides interpretable visual cues for clinical diagnosis.},

Our approach is based on a multi-context ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), aiming at learning different levels of image spatial context and improving detection performance. The main innovation behind the proposed method is the use of multiple-depth CNNs, individually trained on image patches of different dimensions and then combined together. In this way, the final ensemble is able to find and locate abnormalities on the images by exploiting both the local features and the surrounding context of a lesion. Experiments were focused on two well-known medical detection problems that have been recently faced with CNNs: microcalcification detection on full-field digital mammograms and microaneurysm detection on ocular fundus images. To this end, we used two publicly available datasets, INbreast and E-ophtha. Statistically significantly better detection performance were obtained by the proposed ensemble with respect to other approaches in the literature, demonstrating its effectiveness in the detection of small abnormalities.},

	abstract = {Detecting suspicious lesions in medical imaging is the important ﬁrst step in computer-aided detection (CAD) systems. However, detecting abnormalities in breast tissue is diﬃcult due to the lesion’s varying size, shape, margin, and contrast with the background tissue. We focused on mass segmentation, a method that provides notable morphological features by outlining contours of masses. Accurate segmentation is crucial for correct diagnosis. Recent advancements in deep learning have improved object detection and segmentation, and these techniques are also being applied to medical imaging studies. We focused on U-net, which is a recently developed mass segmentation algorithm based on a fully convolutional network. The U-net architecture consists of (1) a contracting path to increase the resolution of the output and (2) a symmetric expanding path to better locate the region of interest. The performance of a U-net model was tested with 63 digital mammograms from INbreast, a publicly available database. We trained the model with images resized to 40x40 pixels and conducted 10-fold cross-validation to prevent overﬁtting. The model’s performance with respect to breast density and the lesion’s BI-RADS rating was also investigated. Dice coeﬃcients (DC) were used as a performance measure to compare the predicted segmentation of the model with the ground truth. Logistic regression and an analysis of variance were performed to determine the signiﬁcance of the DCs with regards to breast density and lesion behavior and to calculate the 95\% conﬁdence interval. The average DC was 0.80. The diﬀerence between DCs for BI-RADS 2 and 4c and for BI-RADS 2 and 5 were signiﬁcant, suggesting that the model has more diﬃculty in segmenting benign lesions.},

            Deep learning (DL) models are becoming pervasive and applicable to computer vision, image processing, and synthesis problems. The performance of these models is often improved through architectural configuration, tweaks, the use of enormous training data, and skillful selection of hyperparameters. The application of deep learning models to medical image processing has yielded interesting performance, capable of correctly detecting abnormalities in medical digital images, making them surpass human physicians. However, advancing research in this domain largely relies on the availability of training datasets. These datasets are sometimes not publicly accessible, insufficient for training, and may also be characterized by a class imbalance among samples. As a result, inadequate training samples and difficulty in accessing new datasets for training deep learning models limit performance and research into new domains. Hence, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been proposed to mediate this gap by synthesizing data similar to real sample images. However, we observed that benchmark datasets with regions of interest (ROIs) for characterizing abnormalities in breast cancer using digital mammography do not contain sufficient data with a fair distribution of all cases of abnormalities. For instance, the architectural distortion and breast asymmetry in digital mammograms are sparsely distributed across most publicly available datasets. This paper proposes a GAN model, named ROImammoGAN, which synthesizes ROI-based digital mammograms. Our approach involves the design of a GAN model consisting of both a generator and a discriminator to learn a hierarchy of representations for abnormalities in digital mammograms. Attention is given to architectural distortion, asymmetry, mass, and microcalcification abnormalities so that training distinctively learns the features of each abnormality and generates sufficient images for each category. The proposed GAN model was applied to MIAS datasets, and the performance evaluation yielded a competitive accuracy for the synthesized samples. In addition, the quality of the images generated was also evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, FSIM, BRISQUE, PQUE, NIQUE, FID, and geometry scores. The results showed that ROImammoGAN performed competitively with state-of-the-art GANs. The outcome of this study is a model for augmenting CNN models with ROI-centric image samples for the characterization of abnormalities in breast images.},

	abstract = {Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a commonly encountered malignancy, accounting for approximately 20\% of new breast cancer diagnoses in the United States. DCIS is characterized by a proliferation of tumor cells within the terminal duct lobular unit with preservation of the basement membrane. Typically nonpalpable and asymptomatic, DCIS is most often detected as calcifications on screening mammography. However, DCIS may also be noncalcified. When compared to calcified DCIS, noncalcified DCIS is more likely to be symptomatic, with patients most often presenting with nipple discharge or a palpable mass. Diagnosing noncalcified DCIS is challenging since it may be occult or subtle on mammography, and ultrasound findings can be nonspecific and may be interpreted as benign fibrocystic changes. In cases with a calcified component of DCIS, the extent of DCIS may be underestimated by mammography because not all involved areas may calcify. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although less readily available than mammography and ultrasound, is advantageous in detecting noncalcified DCIS, especially high grade DCIS, which may not develop microcalcifications. MRI relies on abnormal contrast uptake due to tumor vascularity and changes in vessel density and permeability. This pictoral review presents the spectrum of imaging findings of noncalcified DCIS to assist radiologists in accurately detecting and describing its key imaging findings. Utilizing different modalities, we review the differential diagnoses for noncalcified DCIS, show illustrative cases of noncalcified DCIS, and discuss the importance of this entity.},

	abstract = {Mammography is the ﬁrst option for screening breast cancer. However, some lesions may be missed due to superimposition of breast parenchymal patterns/tissues. Current enhancement methods can highlight some speciﬁc tissues, but the edges are weakened or extra noise is added. For improving the solution, this paper proposed a multiscale contrast enhancement for mammogram using dynamic unsharp masking (UM) in Laplacian pyramid. Laplacian pyramid is utilized to preserve the ﬁne structure at each scale. Dynamic UM is presented to adaptively enhance details and suppress noise simultaneously. The proposed method mainly consists of ﬁve steps: 1) downsample images; 2) calculate the weight of dynamic UM; 3) utilize dynamic UM enhancement for each scale image; 4) subtract the enhancement results for each scale image to acquire Laplacian pyramid images; and 5) restore the ﬁnal enhanced image. To evaluate the proposed method qualitatively and quantitatively, one phantom and three clinical mammography cases were evaluated. Results showed the proposed method can provide much clearer details of the mammary gland. Quantitatively, information entropy and peak signal-to-noise ratio are increased by 0.96 and 3.89 at most compared with the state-of-the-art method. The proposed method has demonstrated that different types of regions are enhanced with the help of a regional adaptive evolution, which has great potential for adaptively enhancing the details and relatively suppressing the noise.},

	abstract = {Each year, the treatment decisions for more than 230, 000 breast cancer patients in the U.S. hinge on whether the cancer has metastasized away from the breast. Metastasis detection is currently performed by pathologists reviewing large expanses of biological tissues. This process is labor intensive and error-prone. We present a framework to automatically detect and localize tumors as small as 100 × 100 pixels in gigapixel microscopy images sized 100, 000×100, 000 pixels. Our method leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and obtains state-of-the-art results on the Camelyon16 dataset in the challenging lesion-level tumor detection task. At 8 false positives per image, we detect 92.4\% of the tumors, relative to 82.7\% by the previous best automated approach. For comparison, a human pathologist attempting exhaustive search achieved 73.2\% sensitivity. We achieve image-level AUC scores above 97\% on both the Camelyon16 test set and an independent set of 110 slides. In addition, we discover that two slides in the Camelyon16 training set were erroneously labeled normal. Our approach could considerably reduce false negative rates in metastasis detection.},

	abstract = {Background:  Recent deep learning (DL) approaches have shown promise in improving sensitivity but have not addressed limitations in radiologist specificity or efficiency.
Purpose:  To develop a DL model to triage a portion of mammograms as cancer free, improving performance and workflow efficiency. Materials and Methods:  In this retrospective study, 223 109 consecutive screening mammograms performed in 66 661 women from January 2009 to December 2016 were collected with cancer outcomes obtained through linkage to a regional tumor registry. This cohort was split by patient into 212 272, 25 999, and 26 540 mammograms from 56 831, 7021, and 7176 patients for training, validation, and testing, respectively. A DL model was developed to triage mammograms as cancer free and evaluated on the test set. A DL-triage workflow was simulated in which radiologists skipped mammograms triaged as cancer free (interpreting them as negative for cancer) and read mammograms not triaged as cancer free by using the original interpreting radiologists’ assessments. Sensitivities, specificities, and percentage of mammograms read were calculated, with and without the DL-triage–simulated workflow. Statistics were computed across 5000 bootstrap samples to assess confidence intervals (CIs). Specificities were compared by using a two-tailed t test (P , .05) and sensitivities were compared by using a one-sided t test with a noninferiority margin of 5\% (P , .05).
Results:  The test set included 7176 women (mean age, 57.8 years 6 10.9 [standard deviation]). When reading all mammograms, radiologists obtained a sensitivity and specificity of 90.6\% (173 of 191; 95\% CI: 86.6\%, 94.7\%) and 93.5\% (24 625 of 26 349; 95\% CI: 93.3\%, 93.9\%). In the DL-simulated workflow, the radiologists obtained a sensitivity and specificity of 90.1\% (172 of 191; 95\% CI: 86.0\%, 94.3\%) and 94.2\% (24 814 of 26 349; 95\% CI: 94.0\%, 94.6\%) while reading 80.7\% (21 420 of 26 540) of the mammograms. The simulated workflow improved specificity (P = .002) and obtained a noninferior sensitivity with a margin of 5\% (P , .001).
Conclusion:  This deep learning model has the potential to reduce radiologist workload and significantly improve specificity without harming sensitivity.},

However, existing techniques for autonomous diagnosis do not surpass a well-trained radiologist. Therefore, to reduce the number of mammograms that require examination by a radiologist, subject to preserving the diagnostic accuracy observed in current clinical practice, we develop Man and Machine Mammography Oracle (MAMMO)—a clinical decision support system capable of determining whether its predicted diagnoses require further radiologist examination. We first introduce a novel multi-view convolutional neural network (CNN) trained using multi-task learning (MTL) to diagnose mammograms and predict the radiological assessments known to be associated with cancer. MTL improves diagnostic performance and triage efficiency while providing an additional layer of model interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel triage network that takes as input the radiological assessment and diagnostic predictions of the multi-view CNN and determines whether the radiologist or CNN will most likely provide the correct diagnosis. Results obtained on a dataset of over 7,000 patients show that MAMMO reduced the number of diagnostic mammograms requiring radiologist reading by 42.8\% while improving the overall diagnostic accuracy in comparison to readings done by radiologists alone.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common malignancy that affects women all over the world, especially in morocco with 35.8\% [1]. The effective way to diagnose and treat breast cancer is the earlier detection of symptoms and signs which can arise the chances of preconizing an earlier treatment, probably specific one. Thus, it can extremely affect the chances to survive by delaying the cancer or the total elimination. Mammography is a highly accurate radiography technique that represents a basic and crucial phase in preventing and detecting early this disease. Using the mammography images, we propose in this paper to develop a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system named Earlier Breast Cancer Computer Aided Detection (EBCCAD) which aim is to detect and classify breast cancer images. The obtained results are promising and encouraging to evaluate the proposed system for real cases.},

The International Conference on Image Analysis and Recognition in 2018 presents the BreAst Cancer Histology (ICIAR2018 BACH) image data challenge that calls for computer tools to assist pathologists and doctors in the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer subtypes. Using the BACH dataset, we have developed an image classification pipeline that combines both a shallow learner (support vector machine) and a deep learner (convolutional neural network). The shallow learner and deep learners achieved moderate accuracies of 79\% and 81\% individually. When being integrated by fusion algorithms, the system outperformed any individual learner with the highest accuracy as 92\%. The fusion presents big potential for improving clinical design support.

	abstract = {Medical errors are considered as the leading cause of death and injury. Breast cancer becomes one of the leading causes of death among women, not only in the Philippines but worldwide. In this paper, data mining was used to predict the stage of breast cancer using a hybrid of fuzzy logic and decision tree. This aims to help experts to make decisions rather than replacing them. The result will only give an expert a recommendation, but the final decision is still on the hands of the experts. Feature selection was used to determine the best attribute in the dataset from Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER). The data set consists of incidence from 1975 to 2016, but the study limits the analysis from 2010 to 2016. Different cleaning and preprocessing of data are conducted. After thorough preprocessing of data, six (6) attributes are selected, and one (1) target class. Performance comparison shows that the fuzzy decision tree achieved a higher accuracy of 99.96\%, sensitivity of 99.26\% and specificity of 99.98\% than the decision tree classification technique. The simulation result shows a correctly classified instance of 165,124, which is equivalent to 99.97\% and only 351 incorrect classified instances or 0.21\%. Thus, a fuzzy decision tree is more robust than the traditional decision tree classifier for predicting the stage of breast cancer.},

Despite the consensus that breast cancer early detection can significantly reduce treatment difficulty and cancer mortality, people still are reluctant to go to hospital for regular checkups due to the high costs incurred. A timely, private, affordable, and effective household breast cancer early detection solution is badly needed. In this paper, we propose a household solution that utilizes pairs of sensors embedded in the bra to measure the thermal and moisture time series data (BTMTSD) of the breast surface and conduct time series classification (TSC) to diagnose breast cancer. Three main challenges are encountered when doing BTMTSD classification, (1) small supervised dataset, which is a common limitation of medical research, (2) noisy time series with unique noise patterns, and (3) complex interplay patterns across multiple time series dimensions. To mitigate these problems, we incorporate multiple data augmentation and transformation techniques with various deep learning TSC approaches and compare their performances for the BTMTSD classification task. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our framework in providing reliable breast cancer early detection.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a topic that is frequently discussed these days. It is one of the most widespread diseases and forms of cancer. The National Cancer Institute says that the second most frequent malignancy in women is breast cancer. Every year, around 2000 new instances of breast cancer are diagnosed in males, while approximately 2,30,000 new cases are diagnosed in women. The diagnosis of this disease is crucial so that women can get it treated in its early stages. It is best for an precise and timely diagnosis. This is a critical phase in the therapy and recovery process. Breast cancer detection is done with the help of mammograms, which are basically X-rays of the breasts. It's a tool that is used to detect and help diagnose breast cancer. But detection is not easy due to different kinds of uncertainties in using these mammograms. Breast cancer can be detected using machine learning algorithms. These approaches can be used to create tools for clinicians that can be used to identify and diagnose breast cancer at an early stage. This will significantly improve patient survival rates.},

The development of massive breast cancer screening has led to earlier diagnosis and rapid management with a significant improvement in survival rate. The problem of automatically searching for information contained in medical images is urgently needed. In order to process this large volume of information, doctors are currently turning to the use of Machine Learning (ML) systems to assist in the analysis and interpretation of these images. In this paper, we have conducted an experimental study for three major ML algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to classify Brest cancer. The experiments were conducted on WDBC dataset to obtain the best algorithms in term of accuracy. Finally, identify the most specific and relevant attributes of the malignant tumour classification through more than one feature selection algorithms.},

	abstract = {Accurate breast cancer detection using automated algorithms remains a problem within the literature. Although a plethora of work has tried to address this issue, an exact solution is yet to be found. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that most of the existing datasets are imbalanced, i.e., the number of instances of a particular class far exceeds that of the others. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the notion of transfer learning to address this issue and focus our efforts on histopathological and imbalanced image classification. We use the popular VGG-19 as the base model and complement it with several state-of-the-art techniques to improve the overall performance of the system. With the ImageNet dataset taken as the source domain, we apply the learned knowledge in the target domain consisting of histopathological images. With experimentation performed on a large-scale dataset consisting of 277,524 images, we show that the framework proposed in this paper gives superior performance than those available in the existing literature. Through numerical simulations conducted on a supercomputer, we also present guidelines for work in transfer learning and imbalanced image classification.},

However early diagnosis increases survivability significantly, therefore making it very important. There are different diagnosis techniques for early detection of breast cancer. Breast tissue samples analyzed under microscope is considered reliable way to diagnose breast cancer. Automated classification techniques are so popular in many areas in order to reduce human dependency considering third world countries. Our purpose is to determine if sample is malignant or benign in automated manner. Many algorithms are studied so far in medical area along with other areas. However, algorithms are generally too complex even for simple tasks. We propose a simple algorithm that can differentiate cancerous and non-cancerous samples from breast tissue in automated manner. The images were taken from Near East University Hospital which is consisted of 50 cancerous and 100 healthy images. Total of 150 images were correctly differentiated through our algorithm.},

However, the different expression patterns of the four HER family genes and their correlation with cancer immune infiltrate have not been analyzed. In this article, we analyzed the expression level of the HER family in breast cancer patients through Oncomine and Interactive Analysis of Gene Expression Profiles (GEPIA). We found that the expression levels of ERBB2 and ERBB3 in invasive breast cancer (BCRA) tissues were higher than those in normal breast tissues, while the expression levels of EGFR in the former were lower than those in the latter. Using the Tumor Immunity Estimation Resource (TIMER) database to study the correlation between the HER family and breast cancer immune infiltrates shows that the expression of the HER family is significantly associated with tumor purity and the level of infiltration of various immune cells. This study laid the foundation for further exploration of the molecular mechanism of the HER family in breast cancer.},

This study chose gene expression profile of GSE65194, GSE42568, GSE7904 and GSE10810 from GEO databases in order to screen potential biomarkers of breast cancer. There are 393 samples, including 331 cancer samples and 62 normal samples. We screened the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from four groups between BRCA samples and normal samples, then 150 common DEGs were detected, including 37 upregulated genes and 113 downregulated genes. Next this study used Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Moreover, we selected 15 core genes with high connectivity, including CCNB1, CDC20, BUB1B, AURKA, CDK1 and RRM2. The Kaplan Meier plotter (KM plotter) analyzed these six core genes survival rate. Finally, this study analyzed that all six genes were significantly expressed in BRCA. In conclusion, the bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that the six core genes CCNB1, CDK1, BUB1B, CDC20, AURKA and RRM2 might promote the development of BRCA, that could became new biomarkers for diagnosis and medications of BRCA.},

Furthermore, human lives are changing with Big Data covering a wide of array of science knowledge and with Data Mining solving problems by analyzing data and discovering patterns in present databases. The prediction process is heavily data driven and therefore advanced machine learning techniques are often utilized. In this paper, we will take a look at what types experiment data are typically used, do preliminary analysis on them, and generate breast cancer prediction models - all with PySpark and its machine learning frameworks. Using a database with more than a hundred sets of data gathered in routine blood analysis, the accuracy rates of detection and classification are about 72\% and 83\% respectively.},

This work builds a prediction model for the NPI \&lt; 3.4 versus NPI ≥ 3.4, where this threshold is the cut-off between high survival rate versus the low survival rate.In this study, we present a supervised learning method used to predict the breast cancer NPI. The objectives of this research are (i) build a diagnosis system for breast cancer NPI based on multi-omics data; (ii) find gene biomarkers for each low and high NPI scores; (iii) build a novel prediction model based on t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and residual neural network (ResNet) to integrate multi-omics data in the classification mechanism. The results show that two sets of biomarkers that include two different omics, namely gene expression and copy number alteration, can be integrated in the model to achieve a high prediction accuracy. Findings in the literature confirm the associations between some of these genes and breast cancer.},

The task of correctly diagnosing cancer using histopathology in its very earlier stages is a challenging and critical task. Most of the present machine learning techniques require a lot of data to analyze and predict a benign tumour in its early stages, and such data is not available readily. In this paper, we propose the idea of data augmentation of breast cancer tissue images by addressing data intrinsic characteristics. The aim is to detect the micro presence of the tumour cells and highlight it over multiple synthetic images for classifiers to predict benign tumours in very early stages with high accuracy. The initial experimental analysis highlights the proposed technique’s impact and significance in boosting the performance of standard classifier(s).},

	abstract = {Objectives
              The objective of this study was to develop and validate a state-of-the-art, deep learning (DL)-based model for detecting breast cancers on mammography.
            
            
              Methods
              Mammograms in a hospital development dataset, a hospital test dataset, and a clinic test dataset were retrospectively collected from January 2006 through December 2017 in Osaka City University Hospital and Medcity21 Clinic. The hospital development dataset and a publicly available digital database for screening mammography (DDSM) dataset were used to train and to validate the RetinaNet, one type of DL-based model, with five-fold cross-validation. The model’s sensitivity and mean false positive indications per image (mFPI) and partial area under the curve (AUC) with 1.0 mFPI for both test datasets were externally assessed with the test datasets.
            
            
              Results
              The hospital development dataset, hospital test dataset, clinic test dataset, and DDSM development dataset included a total of 3179 images (1448 malignant images), 491 images (225 malignant images), 2821 images (37 malignant images), and 1457 malignant images, respectively. The proposed model detected all cancers with a 0.45–0.47 mFPI and had partial AUCs of 0.93 in both test datasets.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The DL-based model developed for this study was able to detect all breast cancers with a very low mFPI. Our DL-based model achieved the highest performance to date, which might lead to improved diagnosis for breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer, behind skin cancer, is the second most frequent malignancy among women, initiated by an unregulated cell division in breast tissues. Although early mammogram screening and treatment result in decreased mortality, differentiating cancer cells from surrounding tissues are often fallible, resulting in fallacious diagnosis. Method: The mammography dataset is used to categorize breast cancer into four classes with low computational complexity, introducing a feature extraction-based approach with machine learning (ML) algorithms. After artefact removal and the preprocessing of the mammograms, the dataset is augmented with seven augmentation techniques. The region of interest (ROI) is extracted by employing several algorithms including a dynamic thresholding method. Sixteen geometrical features are extracted from the ROI while eleven ML algorithms are investigated with these features. Three ensemble models are generated from these ML models employing the stacking method where the first ensemble model is built by stacking ML models with an accuracy of over 90\% and the accuracy thresholds for generating the rest of the ensemble models are {\textgreater}95\% and {\textgreater}96. Five feature selection methods with fourteen configurations are applied to notch up the performance. Results: The Random Forest Importance algorithm, with a threshold of 0.045, produces 10 features that acquired the highest performance with 98.05\% test accuracy by stacking Random Forest and XGB classifier, having a higher than {\textgreater}96\% accuracy. Furthermore, with K-fold cross-validation, consistent performance is observed across all K values ranging from 3–30. Moreover, the proposed strategy combining image processing, feature extraction and ML has a proven high accuracy in classifying breast cancer.},

Scientiﬁc ﬁndings reveal that supervised deep learning methods’ performance heavily depends on training set size, which expert radiologists must manually annotate. The latter is quite a tiring and time-consuming task. Therefore, most of the freely accessible biomedical image datasets are small-sized. Furthermore, it is challenging to have big-sized medical image datasets due to privacy and legal issues. Consequently, not a small number of supervised deep learning models are prone to overﬁtting and cannot produce generalized output. One of the most popular methods to mitigate the issue above goes under the name of data augmentation. This technique helps increase training set size by utilizing various transformations and has been publicized to improve the model performance when tested on new data. This article surveyed different data augmentation techniques employed on mammogram images. The article aims to provide insights into basic and deep learning-based augmentation techniques.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a serious medical condition that requires early detection for successful treatment. Mammography is a commonly used imaging technique for breast cancer screening, but its analysis can be time-consuming and subjective. This study explores the use of deep learning-based methods for mammogram analysis, with a focus on improving the performance of the analysis process. The study is focused on applying different computer vision models, with both CNN and ViT architectures, on a publicly available dataset. The innovative approach is represented by the data augmentation technique based on synthetic images, which are generated to improve the performance of the models. The results of the study demonstrate the importance of data pre-processing and augmentation techniques for achieving high classiﬁcation performance. Additionally, the study utilizes explainable AI techniques, such as class activation maps and centered bounding boxes, to better understand the models’ decision-making process.},

	abstract = {It is well known that the addition of noise to the input data of a neural network during training can, in some circumstances, lead to significant improvements in generalization performance. Previous work has shown that such training with noise is equivalent to a form of regularization in which an extra term is added to the error function. However, the regularization term, which involves second derivatives of the error function, is not bounded below, and so can lead to difficulties if used directly in a learning algorithm based on error minimization. In this paper we show that for the purposes of network training, the regularization term can be reduced to a positive semi-definite form that involves only first derivatives of the network mapping. For a sum-of-squares error function, the regularization term belongs to the class of generalized Tikhonov regularizers. Direct minimization of the regularized error function provides a practical alternative to training with noise.},

	abstract = {Perforin-2 (MPEG1) is an effector of the innate immune system that limits the proliferation and spread of medically relevant Gram-negative, -positive, and acid fast bacteria. We show here that a cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex containing cullin-1 and βTrCP monoubiquitylates Perforin-2 in response to pathogen associated molecular patterns such as LPS. Ubiquitylation triggers a rapid redistribution of Perforin-2 and is essential for its bactericidal activity. Enteric pathogens such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli disarm host cells by injecting cell cycle inhibiting factors (Cifs) into mammalian cells to deamidate the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8. Because CRL activity is dependent upon NEDD8, Cif blocks ubiquitin dependent trafficking of Perforin-2 and thus, its bactericidal activity. Collectively, these studies further underscore the biological significance of Perforin-2 and elucidate critical molecular events that culminate in Perforin-2-dependent killing of both intracellular and extracellular, cell-adherent bacteria.
          , 
            A wide range of bacteria and other microbes can infect animals and cause disease. Throughout evolution, these microbes and their hosts have been fighting never ending arms races in which the microbes deploy ever more elaborate weapons, while the hosts adapt to defend themselves. An animal's first line of defense is provided by its ‘innate’ immune system. This system is activated by the general features of microbial cells; for example, the molecules that make up the walls surrounding most bacteria. Microbes must defeat the innate immune system in order to cause disease, and ultimately to spread from one host to the next.
            One component of innate immunity is a protein called Perforin-2 that is present in most, if not all, animal cells. This protein forms pores on bacterial cells, causing them to split open and die. However, it was not clear how Perforin-2 is switched on and what, if anything, bacteria do to counteract it. To address these questions, McCormack et al. infected human and mice cells with bacteria that cause serious diseases of the digestive tract.
            The experiments show that when animal cells detect bacteria, or merely a fragment of their cell wall, a specific group of proteins, called the CRL complex, attaches a molecule called ubiquitin to Perforin-2. Ubiquitin works much like the shipping label of a package, enabling the efficient targeting of Perforin-2 to the invading bacteria. McCormack et al. also show that some bacteria use a protein called a cell cycle inhibiting factor (or Cif for short) to inhibit the CRL complex. This blocks the ubiquitin labeling of Perforin-2, which renders it a useless weapon that can no longer be directed towards bacteria.
            Mice that are infected with a bacterium called Yersinia pseudotuberculosis become seriously unwell and often die. However, McCormack et al. found that mice infected with mutant Y. pseudotuberculosis that lacked Cif remained healthy. Also, mice that lacked Perforin-2 are highly susceptible to infectious diseases. McCormack et al.'s findings reveal how Perforin-2 is activated during the innate immune response and how some bacteria can defeat this pivotal defense. In the current age of antibiotic resistant bacteria, these studies may spur the development of new drugs that restore or increase the activity of Perforin-2.},

Random Erasing is parameter learning free, easy to implement, and can be integrated with most of the CNN-based recognition models. Albeit simple, Random Erasing is complementary to commonly used data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and flipping, and yields consistent improvement over strong baselines in image classification, object detection and person re-identification.

              This paper presents a novel machine learning approach to perform an early prediction of the healthcare cost of breast cancer patients. The learning phase of our prediction method considers the following two steps: (1) in the first step, the patients are clustered taking into account the sequences of actions undergoing similar clinical activities and ensuring similar healthcare costs, and (2) a Markov chain is then learned for each group to describe the action-sequences of the patients in the cluster. A two step procedure is undertaken in the prediction phase: (1) first, the healthcare cost of a new patient’s treatment is estimated based on the average healthcare cost of its
              k
              -nearest neighbors in each group, and (2) finally, an aggregate measure of the healthcare cost estimated by each group is used as the final predicted cost.
 Experiments undertaken reveal a mean absolute percentage error as small as 6\%, even when half of the clinical records of a patient is available, substantiating the early prediction capability of the proposed method. Comparative analysis substantiates the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art techniques.},

	abstract = {The prompt and accurate diagnosis of breast lesions, including the distinction between cancer, non-cancer, and suspicious cancer, plays a crucial role in the prognosis of breast cancer. In this paper, we introduce a novel method based on feature extraction and reduction for the detection of breast cancer in mammography images. First, we extract features from multiple pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models, and then concatenate them. The most informative features are selected based on their mutual information with the target variable. Subsequently, the selected features can be classified using a machine learning algorithm. We evaluate our approach using four different machine learning algorithms: neural network (NN), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). Our results demonstrate that the NN-based classifier achieves an impressive accuracy of 92\% on the RSNA dataset. This dataset is newly introduced and includes two views as well as additional features like age, which contributed to the improved performance. We compare our proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its superiority, particularly in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. For the MIAS dataset, we achieve an accuracy as high as 94.5\%, and for the DDSM dataset, an accuracy of 96\% is attained. These results highlight the effectiveness of our method in accurately diagnosing breast lesions and surpassing existing approaches.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer has evolved as the most lethal illness impacting women all over the globe. Breast cancer may be detected early, which reduces mortality and increases the chances of a full recovery. Researchers all around the world are working on breast cancer screening tools based on medical imaging. Deep learning approaches have piqued the attention of many in the medical imaging field due to their rapid growth. In this research, mammography pictures were utilized to detect breast cancer. We have used four mammography imaging datasets with a similar number of 1145 normal, benign, and malignant pictures using various deep CNN (Inception V4, ResNet-164, VGG-11, and DenseNet121) models as base classifiers. The proposed technique employs an ensemble approach in which the Gompertz function is used to build fuzzy rankings of the base classification techniques, and the decision scores of the base models are adaptively combined to construct final predictions. The proposed fuzzy ensemble techniques outperform each individual transfer learning methodology as well as multiple advanced ensemble strategies (Weighted Average, Sugeno Integral) with reference to prediction and accuracy. The suggested Inception V4 ensemble model with fuzzy rank based Gompertz function has a 99.32\% accuracy rate. We believe that the suggested approach will be of tremendous value to healthcare practitioners in identifying breast cancer patients early on, perhaps leading to an immediate diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer claims 11,400 lives on average every year in the UK, making it one of the deadliest diseases. Mammography is the gold standard for detecting early signs of breast cancer, which can help cure the disease during its early stages. However, incorrect mammography diagnoses are common and may harm patients through unnecessary treatments and operations (or a lack of treatment). Therefore, systems that can learn to detect breast cancer on their own could help reduce the number of incorrect interpretations and missed cases. Various deep learning techniques, which can be used to implement a system that learns how to detect instances of breast cancer in mammograms, are explored throughout this paper. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) are used as part of a pipeline based on deep learning techniques. A divide and conquer approach is followed to analyse the effects on performance and efficiency when utilising diverse deep learning techniques such as varying network architectures (VGG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2), class weights, input sizes, image ratios, pre-processing techniques, transfer learning, dropout rates, and types of mammogram projections. This approach serves as a starting point for model development of mammography classification tasks. Practitioners can benefit from this work by using the divide and conquer results to select the most suitable deep learning techniques for their case out-of-the-box, thus reducing the need for extensive exploratory experimentation. Multiple techniques are found to provide accuracy gains relative to a general baseline (VGG19 model using uncropped 512 × 512 pixels input images with a dropout rate of 0.2 and a learning rate of 1 × 10
              −3
              ) on the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM) dataset. These techniques involve transfer learning pre-trained ImagetNet weights to a MobileNetV2 architecture, with pre-trained weights from a binarised version of the mini Mammography Image Analysis Society (mini-MIAS) dataset applied to the fully connected layers of the model, coupled with using weights to alleviate class imbalance, and splitting CBIS-DDSM samples between images of masses and calcifications. Using these techniques, a 5.6\% gain in accuracy over the baseline model was accomplished. Other deep learning techniques from the divide and conquer approach, such as larger image sizes, do not yield increased accuracies without the use of image pre-processing techniques such as Gaussian filtering, histogram equalisation and input cropping.},

	abstract = {This CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM) is an updated and standardized version of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). The DDSM is a database of 2,620 scanned film mammography studies. It contains normal, benign, and malignant cases with verified pathology information. The scale of the database along with ground truth validation makes the DDSM a useful tool in the development and testing of decision support systems. The CBIS-DDSM collection includes a subset of the DDSM data selected and curated by a trained mammographer. The images have been decompressed and converted to DICOM format. Updated ROI segmentation and bounding boxes, and pathologic diagnosis for training data are also included. Published research results from work in developing decision support systems in mammography are difficult to replicate due to the lack of a standard evaluation data set; most computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) algorithms for breast cancer in mammography are evaluated on private data sets or on unspecified subsets of public databases. Few well-curated public datasets have been provided for the mammography community. These include the DDSM, the Mammographic Imaging Analysis Society (MIAS) database, and the Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA) project. Although these public data sets are useful, they are limited in terms of data set size and accessibility. For example, most researchers using the DDSM do not leverage all its images for a variety of historical reasons. When the database was released in 1997, computational resources to process hundreds or thousands of images were not widely available. Additionally, the DDSM images are saved in non-standard compression files that require the use of decompression code that has not been updated or maintained for modern computers. Finally, the ROI annotations for the abnormalities in the DDSM were provided to indicate a general position of lesions, but not a precise segmentation for them. Therefore, many researchers must implement segmentation algorithms for accurate feature extraction. This causes an inability to directly compare the performance of methods or to replicate prior results. The CBIS-DDSM collection addresses that challenge by publicly releasing an curated and standardized version of the DDSM for evaluation of future CADx and CADe systems (sometimes referred to generally as CAD) research in mammography.},

            Breast cancer is more common on the left side than the right side. We aim to evaluate differences in clinicopathological and genomic characteristics based on laterality. We analyzed survival outcomes and clinical characteristics of 881,320 patients recorded by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to explore genomic and clinical features from 1,062 patients. Gene expression data was used to quantitate cytolytic activity and hallmark gene-sets were used for gene set enrichment analysis. An institutional retrospective review was conducted on 155 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Patient characteristics were summarized by pathological complete response (pCR). Left sided tumors were found to be more prevalent than right sided tumors. No major clinicopathological differences were noted by laterality. Left sided breast cancer demonstrated poorer outcomes versus right sided tumors (HR 1.05, 95\% CI 1.01–1.08; p = 0.011). Cell proliferation gene sets, including E2F Targets, G2M Checkpoint, Mitotic spindle, and MYC Targets, were enriched on the left side compared to the right. Left sided tumors had lower pCR rates versus right sided tumors (15.4\% versus 29.9\%, p = 0.036). Our findings suggest that left sided breast cancer is associated with aggressive biology and worse outcomes compared to right sided breast cancer.},

	abstract = {The most significant features that indicate whether a mass is benign or malignant are its shape and margins (Figure 36f-4). The shape can be round, oval, lobular, or irregular. Circumscribed oval and round masses are usually benign. An irregular shape suggests a greater likelihood of malignancy. The margins can be described as circumscribed, microlobulated, obscured (partially hidden by adjacent tissue), indistinct (ill-defined), or spiculated (characterized by lines radiating from the mass). The likelihood of malignancy with a circumscribed mass is very low, but additional work-up may be necessary to verify that the margins are completely circumscribed. Typical examples of benign circumscribed masses are cysts (Figure 36f-5) and fibroadenomas (Figure 36f-6). Ultrasonography can determine whether a circumscribed mass is cystic or solid. If the mass is a simple cyst, no further work-up is necessary. If solid, the shape and margins should be evaluated carefully, possibly with magnification mammography. Unless there are previous mammograms to establish that it is a new finding, a solitary, completely circumscribed, nonpalpable, solid mass is often managed by 6-month follow-up examination to establish that the mass is stable (not growing).8 If it is stable, continued mammographic surveillance is recommended for at least 2 years. If a circumscribed mass is directly adjacent to fibroglandular tissue of similar density, the margins of the mass may be obscured, and spot compression is used to show the margins of the mass more completely.Figure 36f-4Terminology used to describe masses.Figure 36f-5Cyst.
