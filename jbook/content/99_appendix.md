## Variable Definitions

### BI-RADS Assessment

This is an assessment category in the overall summary of the mammography report.


| Label | Description                                                                              | Likelihood of Cancer                                                        |

### Breast Density

This is an overall assessment of the volume of attenuating tissues in the breast, to help indicate the relative possibility that a lesion could be obscured by normal tissue and that the sensitivity of examination thereby may be compromised by dense breast tissue. The following four categories of breast composition are defined by the visually estimated content of fibroglandular-density tissue within the breasts. {cite}`americancollegeofradiologyACRBIRADSAtlas2013a`.

| Label | Description                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | The breasts are almost entirely fatty                                          |
| 2     | There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density                            |
| 3     | The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses          |
| 4     | The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of   mammography |

### Calcification Distribution

These descriptors refer to the arrangement of the calcifications inside the breast and, relative to the probability of malignancy.

| Label               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CLUSTERED           | a cluster of at least 5 calcifications within 1 cm from each other, in an   area at most 2 cm in greatest linear dimension; more likely to be malignant   with smaller calcific particle sizes (<1 mm) and suspicious shape |
| LINEAR              | calcifications arranged in a linear path that can branch, suggesting   calcified debris within a duct. These require further evaluation.                                                                                    |
| REGIONAL            | calcifications cover an extensive area, more than one quadrant                                                                                                                                                              |
| DIFFUSELY_SCATTERED | random distribution throughout the breast, considered benign                                                                                                                                                                |
| SEGMENTAL           | calcifications follow the anatomic triangular shape of a breast lobe with   tip towards the nipple. These require further evaluation.                                                                                       |
| CLUSTERED-LINEAR    | clustered calcifications that are also arranged in a linear path                                                                                                                                                            |
| CLUSTERED-SEGMENTAL | cluster of at least 5 calcifications that follow the anatomic triangular   shape of the breast lobe                                                                                                                         |
| LINEAR-SEGMENTAL    | calcifications that are arranged in a linear path and follow the anatomic   triangular shape of the breast lobe.                                                                                                            |
