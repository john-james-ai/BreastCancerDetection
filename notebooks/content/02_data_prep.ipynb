    "The data are currently split into train and test sets by BI-RADS category. While convenient for modeling, this is rather cumbersome for the exploratory data analysis which considers the entire dataset, before making any assumptions. Our first task is to combine the train and test sets into separate datasets by BI-RADS category, facilitating a top-down, comprehensive view of all the data during analysis. \n",

The latter indicates that some aspect of the case as worth tracking; but, no follow-up is required. For our purposes, that is a distinction without a difference. Nonetheless, rather than modifying the variable and lose potentially useful information, we'll create a new target variable, 'cancer', which will be True if pathology is 'MALIGNANT', and False otherwise. \n",

    "The CBIS-DDSM creators define a case as a particular abnormality as seen in the cranial caudal (CC) or mediolateral oblique (MLO) views; yet, the dataset lacks a unique case identifier. Consequently, five different variables are required to map metadata with their associated image. To enable direct matching between metadata and DICOM images, each case will be assigned a unique identifier, which will be cross-referenced to a full mammogram, ROI mask, or cropped image series dataset."

In this regard, we need an objective method, based on computational models, that can predict a radiologist's perception of the quality of an image. For this task, we will use the Blind/Reference-less Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) algorithm. A widely used, state-of-the-art No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) model, BRISQUE measures image quality using locally normalized luminance coefficients and image features. \n",
