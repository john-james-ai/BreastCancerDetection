    "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **CBIS-DDSM** Dataset\n",

    "## CBIS-DDSM Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed in 1997 through a grant from the DOD Breast Cancer Research Program and the US Army Research and Material Command, the *original* Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) {cite}`USFDigitalMammography` is a collection of 2620 cases obtained by patient consent from Massachusetts General Hospital, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Sacred Heart Hospital, and Washington University of St. Louis School of Medicine. Its cases are annotated with ROIs for calcifications and masses, they include Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) descriptors for mass shape, mass margin, calcification type, calcification distribution, and breast density. They also include overall BI-RADS assessments from 0 to 5 and ratings of the subtlety of the abnormalities from 1 to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DDSM, a powerful and extensively used resource for imaging research, presented certain challenges that limited its accessibility and utility.  For instance, the original DDSM was saved in lossless JPEG files (LJPEG); a non-standard, and obsolete compression format. Regions of interest marked the general area of legions; but, lacked the specificity of precise image segmentation, requiring researchers to implement segmentation algorithms for accurate feature extraction. Some annotations marked legions that could not be seen. Further, the metadata processing and image correction routines distributed with the dataset were a set of bash and C routines that were difficult to refactor.\n",
    "This Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM) {cite}`leeCuratedMammographyData2017` is an updated and standardized version of the original DDSM, developed to address some of the challenges. In particular, the questionable annotations were reviewed by a trained mammographer, and 254 images were removed from the dataset. The images were converted from PVRG-JPEG to 8-bit raw binary bitmaps. Python tools were developed to convert the 8-bit images to 16-bit grayscale TIFF files, which were later converted to DICOM. The bash and C preprocessing tools were re-implemented in Python to be cross-platform. Convenience images were cropped around the region of interest for researchers analyzing only the abnormalities. Precise segmentation was applied to the calcification images providing much more accurate regions of interest, and the data were split into training and test sets, based on the BI-RADS category to support method evaluation and reproducibility.\n",

    "### Exploratory Data Analysis: Data Preparation\n",
    "Several issues must be addressed before engaging in the EDA. First, the data are split into training and test sets for each abnormality type. The objective of the EDA is to evaluate the *entire* dataset before making any assumptions. Hence, data currently split into training and test sets must be combined. In addition, the data are split by abnormality type. Variables such as breast density, subtlety, BI-RADS assessment, and diagnosis are common to mass and calcification cases and should be analyzed together. A cross-dataset containing the intersection of variables in the mass and calcification datasets must be created to explore these common variables across abnormality types. The target variable, pathology, currently contains three distinct values: 'MALIGNANT', 'BENIGH', and 'BENIGN WITHOUT CALLBACK'. Our classification task requires two outcomes, 'MALIGNANT', and 'BENIGN'. A new variable must be created that combines 'BENIGN' and 'BENIGN WITHOUT CALLBACK' for analysis and modeling. Image size, dimension, aspect ratio, and pixel values are properties that must be understood before feature engineering and modeling. These properties must be extracted from the DICOM files for analysis.  Finally, the file path variables have no clinical significance and should be removed. Hence, we will be performing the following data preparation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add Diagnosis Variable: There are three pathologies for our binary classification task ['MALIGNANT', 'BENIGN', 'BENIGN_WITHOUT_CALLBACK']. For this analysis, we will add a new binary variable, 'diagnosis' having two values, 'MALIGNANT', and 'BENIGN'. \n",
    "2. Drop Pathology Variable: For this effort, the diagnosis variable will replace the pathology variable.\n",
    "3. Drop the file path variables from the datasets as they have no clinical value.\n",
    "4. Merge the training and test datasets for calcification and mass cases.\n",
    "5. Create a cross-dataset containing the intersection of variables in the calcification and mass cases.\n",
    "6. Create an image metadata dataset containing image properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of structure, we'll be encoding low-cardinality nominal variables as categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once data preparation is complete, we'll have four datasets:\n",
    "1. Cross-Dataset: Dataset containing training and test data comprised of the intersection of variables in mass and calcification datasets.\n",
    "2. Calcification Dataset: Training and test data for all calcification cases.\n",
